## Intuition
To make the bitwise XOR of all elements of the final array equal to k, we can iterate over each bit of k and the XOR of all elements in nums. For each bit, if the corresponding bits in k and the XOR result are different, we need to flip the bit in nums to make them equal. The minimum number of operations required is the total number of bits that need to be flipped.

## Approach
1. Initialize a variable `finalXor` to store the XOR of all elements in nums.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to store the count of operations required.
3. Iterate until either k or `finalXor` becomes 0.
   - Check if the rightmost bit of k and `finalXor` are different.
   - If they are different, increment `count` by 1.
   - Right shift k and `finalXor` by 1 bit.
4. Return `count`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(log(max(k, finalXor))), where max(k, finalXor) is the maximum of k and the final XOR value. We iterate over the bits of k and finalXor, which takes log2(max(k, finalXor)) operations.
- Space complexity: O(1), constant space is used.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        int finalXor = 0;
        // XOR of all integers in the array.
        for (int n : nums) {
            finalXor = finalXor ^ n;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        // Keep iterating until any of k or finalXor becomes zero.
        while (k > 0 || finalXor > 0) {
            // k % 2 returns the rightmost bit in k,
            // finalXor % 2 returns the rightmost bit in finalXor.
            // Increment counter, if the bits don't match.
            if ((k % 2) != (finalXor % 2)) {
                count++;
            }
            
            // Remove the last bit from both integers.
            k /= 2;
            finalXor /= 2;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
