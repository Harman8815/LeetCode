# [Sum of Distances in Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-28)

## Intuition
To find the sum of distances between each node in the tree, we can use two depth-first searches (DFS). 
1. First, we perform a DFS to calculate two arrays: `count` and `res`.
   - `count[i]` represents the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at node `i`.
   - `res[i]` represents the sum of distances between node `i` and all other nodes in its subtree.
2. Then, we perform a second DFS to update the `res` array based on the parent node's information.

## Approach
1. Initialize a graph as a map of node to its list of children.
2. Initialize `count` and `res` arrays of size `n`, and fill them with 1.
3. Perform the first DFS (`dfs`) starting from node 0 to calculate `count` and `res`.
   - For each child of the current node, if it is not the parent, recursively call `dfs`.
   - Update `count[node]` by adding `count[child]` and update `res[node]` by adding `res[child] + count[child]`.
4. Perform the second DFS (`dfs2`) starting from node 0 to update the `res` array.
   - For each child of the current node, if it is not the parent, update `res[child]` by subtracting `count[child]` and adding `(n - count[child])`.
5. Return the `res` array.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once in both DFS traversals.
- Space complexity: O(n), for the graph, count, and res arrays.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    private Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph;
    private int[] count;
    private int[] res;

    private void dfs(int node, int parent) {
        for (int child : graph.get(node)) {
            if (child != parent) {
                dfs(child, node);
                count[node] += count[child];
                res[node] += res[child] + count[child];
            }
        }
    }

    private void dfs2(int node, int parent) {
        for (int child : graph.get(node)) {
            if (child != parent) {
                res[child] = res[node] - count[child] + (count.length - count[child]);
                dfs2(child, node);
            }
        }
    }

    public int[] sumOfDistancesInTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        graph = new HashMap<>();
        count = new int[n];
        res = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(count, 1);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            graph.get(u).add(v);
            graph.get(v).add(u);
        }

        dfs(0, -1);
        dfs2(0, -1);

        return res;
    }
}
