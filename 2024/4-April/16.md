## Question
Given the root of a binary tree and two integers val and depth, add a row of nodes with value val at the given depth depth.

Note that the root node is at depth 1.

The adding rule is:

- Given the integer depth, for each not null tree node cur at the depth depth - 1, create two tree nodes with value val as cur's left subtree root and right subtree root.
- cur's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root.
- cur's original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root.
- If depth == 1 that means there is no depth depth - 1 at all, then create a tree node with value val as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

## Approach
1. Define a recursive function `add` that takes a TreeNode `root`, an integer `val`, an integer `depth`, and an integer `curr` as arguments.
2. If `root` is null, return null.
3. If `curr` is equal to `depth - 1`:
   - Create new left and right child nodes for `root` with value `val`.
   - Set the left child's left subtree to `root`'s original left subtree and the right child's right subtree to `root`'s original right subtree.
   - Return `root`.
4. Recursively call `add` on `root`'s left child and right child, incrementing `curr` by 1.
5. If `depth` is equal to 1, create a new root node with value `val` and set its left child to the original root of the tree.
6. Return the modified `root`.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursive calls on the stack.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as each node is visited once.

## Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

public class Solution {
    public TreeNode add(TreeNode root, int val, int depth, int curr) {
        if (root == null)
            return null;

        if (curr == depth - 1) {
            TreeNode lTemp = root.left;
            TreeNode rTemp = root.right;

            root.left = new TreeNode(val);
            root.right = new TreeNode(val);
            root.left.left = lTemp;
            root.right.right = rTemp;

            return root;
        }

        root.left = add(root.left, val, depth, curr + 1);
        root.right = add(root.right, val, depth, curr + 1);

        return root;
    }

    public TreeNode addOneRow(TreeNode root, int val, int depth) {
        if (depth == 1) {
            TreeNode newRoot = new TreeNode(val);
            newRoot.left = root;
            return newRoot;
        }

        return add(root, val, depth, 1);
    }
}
