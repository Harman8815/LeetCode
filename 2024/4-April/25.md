# [Longest Ideal String](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-ideal-subsequence/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-25)

## Intuition
To find the length of the longest ideal string, we can use dynamic programming. We can define a state dp[i][c] to represent the length of the longest ideal string ending at index i with the last character having an alphabet order of c. We can then recursively calculate dp[i][c] based on the previous states and the condition for an ideal string.

## Approach
1. Initialize a 2D array dp[N][26] to store the length of the longest ideal string ending at index i with the last character having an alphabet order of c. Initialize all values to -1 to indicate non-visited states.
2. Iterate over all possible characters c from 'a' to 'z' and calculate the maximum length of the ideal string for each c using a depth-first search (dfs) approach.
3. In the dfs function, if the current character matches the character at index i, set dp[i][c] to 1. Otherwise, set dp[i][c] to 0.
4. For non-base cases (i > 0), recursively calculate dp[i][c] by considering two cases:
   - If the current character matches the character at index i, set dp[i][c] to the maximum of its current value and the value obtained by recursively calling dfs for the previous index i - 1 and character c.
   - If the current character does not match the character at index i, iterate over all characters p from 'a' to 'z' and update dp[i][c] to the maximum of its current value and the value obtained by recursively calling dfs for the previous index i - 1 and character p, if the absolute difference between c and p is less than or equal to k.
5. Return the maximum value in the last row of dp, which represents the length of the longest ideal string ending at the last index.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(N * k * 26), where N is the length of the input string s and k is the given integer k. We iterate over each character in the string and each possible character in the alphabet for each character.
- Space complexity: O(N * 26), for the dp array.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestIdealString(String s, int k) {
        int N = s.length();

        // Initialize all dp values to -1 to indicate non-visited states
        int[][] dp = new int[N][26];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], -1);
        }

        // Find the maximum dp[N-1][c] and return the result
        int res = 0;
        for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
            res = Math.max(res, dfs(N - 1, c, dp, s, k));
        }
        return res;
    }

    public int dfs(int i, int c, int[][] dp, String s, int k) {
        // Memoized value
        if (dp[i][c] != -1) {
            return dp[i][c];
        }

        // State is not visited yet
        dp[i][c] = 0;
        boolean match = c == (s.charAt(i) - 'a');
        if (match) {
            dp[i][c] = 1;
        }

        // Non base case handling
        if (i > 0) {
            dp[i][c] = dfs(i - 1, c, dp, s, k);
            if (match) {
                for (int p = 0; p < 26; p++) {
                    if (Math.abs(c - p) <= k) {
                        dp[i][c] = Math.max(dp[i][c], dfs(i - 1, p, dp, s, k) + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[i][c];
    }
}
