# [Minimum Falling Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum-ii/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-26)

## Intuition
To find the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts, we can use dynamic programming. We can define a state dp[i][j] to represent the minimum sum of a falling path ending at element (i, j) of the grid. We can then recursively calculate dp[i][j] based on the previous states.

## Approach
1. Define a recursive function `minPath` to calculate the minimum sum of a falling path ending at element (currRow, col) of the grid, given the last picked column in the previous row.
2. Iterate over all columns in the current row and calculate the minimum sum of a falling path ending at each column, excluding the last picked column in the previous row.
3. If the current row is the first row, return the value of the current element.
4. If the minimum sum of a falling path for the previous row and the last picked column has not been calculated yet, recursively calculate it using the `minPath` function.
5. Update the minimum sum of a falling path ending at the current column by adding the current element to the minimum sum of a falling path for the previous row and the last picked column.
6. Return the minimum sum of a falling path ending at the current column.
7. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the minimum sum of a falling path for each element in the grid, with all values initialized to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
8. Iterate over each element in the grid and calculate the minimum sum of a falling path for each element using the `minPath` function.
9. Return the minimum sum of a falling path for the last row of the grid, which represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid. We iterate over each element in the grid and recursively calculate the minimum sum of a falling path.
- Space complexity: O(n^2), for the dp array.

## Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {

    private int minPath(int[][] arr, int currRow, int lastPickedCol, int C, int[][] dp) {
        int path = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int col = 0; col < C; col++) {
            if (col != lastPickedCol) {
                if (currRow == 0) {
                    path = Math.min(path, arr[currRow][col]);
                    continue;
                }
                if (dp[currRow - 1][col] == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    dp[currRow - 1][col] = minPath(arr, currRow - 1, col, C, dp);
                }
                path = Math.min(path, arr[currRow][col] + dp[currRow - 1][col]);
            }
        }
        return path;
    }

    public int minFallingPathSum(int[][] arr) {
        int C = arr[0].length;
        int R = arr.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[R][C];
        for (int i = 0; i < R; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        return minPath(arr, R - 1, -1, C, dp);
    }
}
