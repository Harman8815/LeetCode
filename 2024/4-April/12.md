## Question
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Approach
1. Initialize variables `left`, `right`, and `storedWater` to store the left max height, right max height, and total stored water, respectively.
2. Iterate over the `height` array from left to right and calculate the left max height for each bar.
3. Iterate over the `height` array from right to left and calculate the right max height for each bar.
4. For each bar, calculate the minimum height between the left and right max heights (this is the height at which water can be stored) and subtract the current bar's height from it to get the amount of water that can be stored at that bar. Add this to the `storedWater`.
5. Return the `storedWater`.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional arrays `left` and `right`, where n is the length of the input `height`.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) due to the iteration through the `height` array twice, where n is the length of `height`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int n = height.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        int[] left = new int[n];
        int[] right = new int[n];
        int storedWater = 0;
        
        left[0] = height[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            left[i] = Math.max(left[i - 1], height[i]);
        }
        
        right[n - 1] = height[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            right[i] = Math.max(right[i + 1], height[i]);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int minHeight = Math.min(left[i], right[i]);
            storedWater += minHeight - height[i];
        }
        
        return storedWater;
    }
}
