# [Open the Lock](https://leetcode.com/problems/open-the-lock/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-22)

## Intuition
We can model this problem as a graph traversal problem, where each node in the graph represents a state of the lock, and each edge represents a move of turning one wheel one slot. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the minimum number of turns required to open the lock.

## Approach
1. Create mappings for the next and previous slot digits for each current slot digit.
2. Initialize a set to store visited and dead-end combinations.
3. Initialize a queue to store combinations generated after each turn.
4. Start with the initial combination '0000'.
5. If the starting combination is a dead-end, return -1.
6. While the queue is not empty, explore all combinations of the current level:
   - Get the current combination from the front of the queue.
   - If the current combination matches the target, return the number of turns.
   - Explore all possible new combinations by turning each wheel in both directions:
     - Generate the new combination by turning the wheel to the next digit.
     - If the new combination is not a dead-end and was never visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
     - Generate the new combination by turning the wheel to the previous digit.
     - If the new combination is not a dead-end and was never visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
7. If the target combination is not reached, return -1.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(10000 * 8) = O(1), as there are at most 10000 possible combinations and we explore each combination up to 8 times (2 directions for each of the 4 wheels).
- Space complexity: O(10000) = O(1), for the visited set and the queue.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int openLock(String[] deadends, String target) {
        Map<Character, Character> nextSlot = Map.of(
            '0', '1', '1', '2', '2', '3', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '6', '6', '7', '7', '8', '8', '9', '9', '0'
        );
        Map<Character, Character> prevSlot = Map.of(
            '0', '9', '1', '0', '2', '1', '3', '2', '4', '3', '5', '4', '6', '5', '7', '6', '8', '7', '9', '8'
        );

        Set<String> visitedCombinations = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(deadends));
        Queue<String> pendingCombinations = new LinkedList<String>();

        int turns = 0;

        if (visitedCombinations.contains("0000")) {
            return -1;
        }

        pendingCombinations.add("0000");
        visitedCombinations.add("0000");

        while (!pendingCombinations.isEmpty()) {
            int currLevelNodesCount = pendingCombinations.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < currLevelNodesCount; i++) {
                String currentCombination = pendingCombinations.poll();

                if (currentCombination.equals(target)) {
                    return turns;
                }

                for (int wheel = 0; wheel < 4; wheel += 1) {
                    StringBuilder newCombination = new StringBuilder(currentCombination);
                    newCombination.setCharAt(wheel, nextSlot.get(newCombination.charAt(wheel)));
                    if (!visitedCombinations.contains(newCombination.toString())) {
                        pendingCombinations.add(newCombination.toString());
                        visitedCombinations.add(newCombination.toString());
                    }

                    newCombination = new StringBuilder(currentCombination);
                    newCombination.setCharAt(wheel, prevSlot.get(newCombination.charAt(wheel)));
                    if (!visitedCombinations.contains(newCombination.toString())) {
                        pendingCombinations.add(newCombination.toString());
                        visitedCombinations.add(newCombination.toString());
                    }
                }
            }
            turns += 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
