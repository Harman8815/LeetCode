## [Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-01)

## Question
Given a string `s` consisting of words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

## Approach
1. Initialize a variable `l` to 1 to store the length of the last word.
2. Initialize a boolean `ch` to false to track if we have encountered a non-space character.
3. Iterate over the characters of the string `s` starting from the end.
   - If the current character is a space and we have encountered a non-space character (`ch` is true), break the loop.
   - If `ch` is true, increment `l` to calculate the length of the last word.
   - If the current character is not a space and `ch` is false, set `ch` to true.
4. Return `l`, which contains the length of the last word.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) because we use only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the characters of the string `s`, where n is the length of `s`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int l = 1;
        boolean ch = false;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == ' ' && ch) {
                break;
            }
            if (ch) l++;
            if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && !ch) ch = !ch;
        }
        return l;
    }
}
