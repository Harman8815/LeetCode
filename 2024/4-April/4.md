## [Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-the-parentheses/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-04)

## Question
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:
1. It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
2. It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
3. It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.

We can similarly define the nesting depth `depth(S)` of any VPS S as follows:
- `depth("") = 0`
- `depth(C) = 0`, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
- `depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B))`, where A and B are VPS's.
- `depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A)`, where A is a VPS.

Given a VPS represented as string `s`, return the nesting depth of `s`.

## Approach
1. Initialize a variable `ans` to 0 to store the maximum nesting depth.
2. Use a stack `st` to keep track of the opening parentheses '(' encountered in the string `s`.
3. Iterate over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - If `c` is '(', push it onto the stack `st`.
   - If `c` is ')', pop an element from the stack `st`.
   - Update `ans` with the maximum of `ans` and the size of the stack `st`.
4. Return `ans`.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the stack `st`, where n is the length of the input string `s`.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the characters of the string `s`, where n is the length of `s`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(String s) {
        int ans = 0;

        Stack<Character> st = new Stack<Character>();
        for (Character c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                st.push(c);
            } else if (c == ')') {
                st.pop();
            }
            
            ans = Math.max(ans, st.size());
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
