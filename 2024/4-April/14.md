## [Sum of Left Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-left-leaves/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-14)

## Question
Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

## Approach
1. If the root is null, return 0.
2. Initialize `ans` to 0.
3. If the left child of the root exists:
   - If the left child is a leaf (both left and right children are null), add its value to `ans`.
   - Otherwise, recursively call `sumOfLeftLeaves` on the left child and add the result to `ans`.
4. Recursively call `sumOfLeftLeaves` on the right child and add the result to `ans`.
5. Return `ans`.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursive calls on the stack.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as each node is visited once.

## Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 * int val;
 * TreeNode left;
 * TreeNode right;
 * TreeNode() {}
 * TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 * TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 * this.val = val;
 * this.left = left;
 * this.right = right;
 * }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;

        int ans = 0;

        if (root.left != null) {
            if (root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null)
                ans += root.left.val;
            else
                ans += sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left);
        }
        ans += sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right);

        return ans;
    }
}
