# [Number of Wonderful Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-wonderful-substrings/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-30)

## Intuition
A wonderful string is a string where at most one letter appears an odd number of times. To count the number of wonderful substrings, we can use the concept of XOR. If the XOR of two prefixes of a string is 0, it means that the characters between those prefixes appear an even number of times, making the substring wonderful.

## Approach
1. Initialize a count array of size 1024 to store XOR values. Since there are 10 lowercase letters, we need 2^10 = 1024 indices to represent all possible XOR values of substrings.
2. Initialize a result variable to store the total number of wonderful substrings.
3. Initialize a prefixXor variable to 0 to represent the XOR value of the prefix.
4. Set the count[prefixXor] to 1, as the empty string "" is a wonderful substring.
5. Iterate through each character in the input string word.
   - Calculate the index of the current character in the count array (charIndex = ch - 'a').
   - Update the prefixXor by XOR-ing the current character's index with prefixXor.
   - Add count[prefixXor] to the result, as the substring from the beginning to the current index is a wonderful substring.
   - For each possible character index (i from 0 to 9), add count[prefixXor ^ (1 << i)] to the result. This handles cases where the substring has exactly one character appearing an odd number of times.
   - Increment count[prefixXor] to account for the current prefix.
6. Return the result.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string word. We iterate through each character in the string.
- Space complexity: O(1), since the count array has a fixed size of 1024.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public long wonderfulSubstrings(String word) {
        long[] count = new long[1024]; // 2^10 to store XOR values
        long result = 0;
        int prefixXor = 0;
        count[prefixXor] = 1;

        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            int charIndex = ch - 'a';
            prefixXor ^= 1 << charIndex;
            result += count[prefixXor];
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                result += count[prefixXor ^ (1 << i)];
            }
            count[prefixXor]++;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
