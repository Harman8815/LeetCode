# [N-th Tribonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-24)

## Intuition
The Tribonacci sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but instead of adding the last two numbers to get the next number, we add the last three numbers. We can solve this problem iteratively by using three variables to keep track of the last three numbers in the sequence.

## Approach
1. Initialize three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with values 0, 1, and 1 respectively.
2. If `n` is less than 2, return `n`.
3. Iterate `n` times, updating the variables as follows:
   - Calculate the next number `d` as the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - Update `a`, `b`, and `c` with the values of `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively.
4. Return the value of `c` as the result.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), as we iterate `n` times to calculate the `n-th` Tribonacci number.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for the variables.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int tribonacci(int n) {
        if (n < 2) return n;
        int a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, d;
        while (n-- > 2) {
            d = a + b + c;
            a = b;
            b = c;
            c = d;
        }
        return c;
    }
}
