## Intuition
To find the minimum height trees (MHTs) in a tree, we can start by identifying the leaves (nodes with only one edge) and gradually remove them from the graph. As we remove the leaves, new leaves will be exposed. This process continues until we are left with either one or two nodes, which will be the roots of the MHTs.

## Approach
1. Create an array `degree` to store the degree of each node and a map `adjacencyList` to store the adjacency list representation of the tree.
2. Populate the `degree` array and `adjacencyList` using the given edges.
3. Initialize a queue `leaves` and add all the leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1) to it.
4. Initialize a variable `remainingNodes` to keep track of the remaining nodes in the graph.
5. While there are more than 2 nodes remaining in the graph, repeat the following steps:
   - Remove all the current leaves from the graph by reducing their neighbors' degrees.
   - Add the new leaves (nodes with degree 1) to the queue.
   - Decrement the `remainingNodes` count by the number of removed leaves.
6. Return the remaining nodes in the queue, which will be the roots of the MHTs.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We traverse each node and edge once.
- Space complexity: O(n), for the degree array, adjacency list, and the queue.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findMinHeightTrees(int n, int[][] edges) {
        if (n == 1) return Collections.singletonList(0);
        
        int[] degree = new int[n];
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adjacencyList = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            degree[edge[0]]++;
            degree[edge[1]]++;
            adjacencyList.computeIfAbsent(edge[0], x -> new ArrayList<>()).add(edge[1]);
            adjacencyList.computeIfAbsent(edge[1], x -> new ArrayList<>()).add(edge[0]);
        }

        Queue<Integer> leaves = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < degree.length; i++) {
            if (degree[i] == 1) {
                leaves.add(i);
            }
        }

        int remainingNodes = n;
        while (remainingNodes > 2) {
            int size = leaves.size();
            remainingNodes -= size;
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int leaf = leaves.poll();
                for (int neighbor : adjacencyList.get(leaf)) {
                    if (--degree[neighbor] == 1) {
                        leaves.add(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(leaves);
    }
}
