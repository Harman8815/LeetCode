## Question
You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix land where a 0 represents a hectare of forested land and a 1 represents a hectare of farmland.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist entirely of farmland. These rectangular areas are called groups. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is not four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

land can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of land is (0, 0) and the bottom right corner of land is (m-1, n-1). Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each group of farmland. A group of farmland with a top left corner at (r1, c1) and a bottom right corner at (r2, c2) is represented by the 4-length array [r1, c1, r2, c2].

Return a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each group of farmland in land. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in any order.

## Approach
1. Define a helper method `BFS` to perform a breadth-first search from a given starting point (top-left corner of a potential farmland group).
2. Iterate over each cell in the grid.
3. If the cell is farmland (grid[i][j] == 1) and has not been visited yet, perform a BFS from this cell to find the entire farmland group.
4. Add the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the farmland group to the result list.
5. Return the result list as a 2D array.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid, as we use a boolean matrix to track visited cells.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid, as we visit each cell once and perform a BFS from each unvisited farmland cell.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    // The four directions in which traversal will be done.
    int[][] dirs = {{-1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}};

    // Returns true if the coordinate is within the boundary of the matrix.
    private boolean isWithinFarm(int x, int y, int N, int M) {
        return x >= 0 && x < N && y >= 0 && y < M;
    }

    private Pair<Integer, Integer> BFS(Queue<Pair<Integer, Integer>> q, int[][] land,
        boolean[][] visited) {
        Pair<Integer, Integer> curr = new Pair<Integer, Integer>(0, 0);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            curr = q.remove();

            int x = curr.getKey();
            int y = curr.getValue();

            for (int[] dir : dirs) {
                // Neighbor cell coordinates.
                int newX = x + dir[0], newY = y + dir[1];

                // If the neighbor is within the matrix and is a farmland cell and not visited yet.
                if (isWithinFarm(newX, newY, land.length, land[0].length) && !visited[newX][newY]
                        && land[newX][newY] == 1) {
                    visited[newX][newY] = true;
                    q.add(new Pair(newX, newY));
                }
            }
        }

        return curr;
    }

    public int[][] findFarmland(int[][] land) {
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[land.length][land[0].length];
        List<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>();


        for (int row1 = 0; row1 < land.length; row1++) {
            for (int col1 = 0; col1 < land[0].length; col1++) {
                if (land[row1][col1] == 1 && !visited[row1][col1]) {
                    Queue<Pair<Integer, Integer>> q = new LinkedList<>();

                    q.add(new Pair(row1, col1));
                    visited[row1][col1] = true;

                    Pair<Integer, Integer> last = BFS(q, land, visited);

                    int[] arr = new int[] {row1, col1, last.getKey(), last.getValue()};
                    ans.add(arr);
                }
            }
        }

        return ans.stream().toArray(int[][] :: new);
    }
}
