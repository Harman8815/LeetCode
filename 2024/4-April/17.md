## [Smallest String Starting From Leaf](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-starting-from-leaf/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-17)

## Question
You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range [0, 25] representing the letters 'a' to 'z'.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller.

For example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".
A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.

## Approach
1. Define a recursive function `dfs` that takes a `TreeNode` `root` and a `String` `currentString` as arguments.
2. If `root` is null, return.
3. Construct the current string by appending the character corresponding to the node's value to `currentString`.
4. If `root` is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right child):
   - If `smallestString` is empty or `currentString` is lexicographically smaller than `smallestString`, update `smallestString` to `currentString`.
5. Recursively call `dfs` on `root`'s left child if it exists.
6. Recursively call `dfs` on `root`'s right child if it exists.
7. Return `smallestString`.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursive calls on the stack.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as each node is visited once.

## Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

    public String smallestFromLeaf(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, "");
        return smallestString;
    }

    // Helper function to find the lexicographically smallest string
    void dfs(TreeNode root, String currentString) {
        // If the current node is NULL, return
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }

        // Construct the current string by appending 
        // the character corresponding to the node's value
        currentString = (char) (root.val + 'a') + currentString;

        // If the current node is a leaf node
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            // If the current string is smaller than the result 
            // or if the result is empty
            if (smallestString.isEmpty() || smallestString.compareTo(currentString) > 0) {
                smallestString = currentString;
            }
        }

        // Recursively traverse the left subtree
        if (root.left != null) {
            dfs(root.left, currentString);
        } 

        // Recursively traverse the right subtree
        if (root.right != null) {
            dfs(root.right, currentString);
        }
    }
