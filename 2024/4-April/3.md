## Question
Given an m x n grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return true if `word` exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

## Approach
1. Iterate through each cell in the `board`.
2. If the current cell matches the first character of the `word`, perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from that cell to find the `word`.
3. In the DFS, check if the current cell matches the next character in the `word` and continue the search in all four directions (up, down, left, right) if the conditions are met.
4. Mark the visited cell with a special character (e.g., `'#'`) to avoid revisiting the same cell.
5. If the DFS reaches the end of the `word`, return true. Otherwise, backtrack and restore the original character in the cell.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(m*n) due to the recursive stack space, where m and n are the dimensions of the `board`.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(m*n*4^l), where l is the length of the `word`, as for each cell, we can explore up to 4 directions, and the maximum depth of the recursion is the length of the `word`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        for(int i = 0; i < board.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++){
                if(board[i][j] == word.charAt(0)){
                    if(recursion(board, i, j, 0, word)){
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    public boolean recursion(char[][] arr, int x, int y, int index, String word){
        if(index == word.length()-1){
            return true;
        }

        if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= arr.length || y >= arr[0].length || arr[x][y] != word.charAt(index)){
            return false;
        }

        char temp = arr[x][y];
        arr[x][y] = '#';

        boolean found = recursion(arr, x+1, y, index+1, word) ||
                        recursion(arr, x-1, y, index+1, word) ||
                        recursion(arr, x, y+1, index+1, word) ||
                        recursion(arr, x, y-1, index+1, word);

        arr[x][y] = temp;

        return found;
    }
}
