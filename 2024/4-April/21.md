# [Valid Path in a Directed Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-21)

## Intuition
To determine if there is a valid path from the source vertex to the destination vertex in the given bi-directional graph, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the source vertex. We'll keep track of visited vertices to avoid revisiting them and return true if we reach the destination vertex during the DFS.

## Approach
1. Create a HashMap `graph` to represent the graph, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of its neighboring vertices.
2. Populate the `graph` using the edges array.
3. Start DFS from the source vertex, marking visited vertices along the way.
4. If the destination vertex is reached during the DFS, return true.
5. If the DFS completes without reaching the destination vertex, return false.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. We visit each vertex and each edge once during the DFS.
- Space complexity: O(V + E), for the graph and visited set.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validPath(int n, int[][] edges, int source, int destination) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            graph.computeIfAbsent(u, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(v);
            graph.computeIfAbsent(v, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(u);
        }
        
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        return dfs(source, destination, graph, visited);
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(int node, int destination, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, Set<Integer> visited) {
        if (node == destination) {
            return true;
        }
        visited.add(node);
        for (int neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(node, new ArrayList<>())) {
            if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                if (dfs(neighbor, destination, graph, visited)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
