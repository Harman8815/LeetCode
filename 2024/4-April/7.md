## [Valid Parenthesis String](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-07)

## Question
Given a string `s` containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', return true if `s` is valid.

The following rules define a valid string:
- Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
- Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
- Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
- '*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string "".

## Approach
1. Initialize two variables `low` and `high` to track the possible minimum and maximum number of '(' characters.
2. Iterate over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - If `c` is '(', increment both `low` and `high`.
   - If `c` is ')', decrement both `low` and `high`.
   - If `c` is '*', decrement `low` and increment `high`.
   - If `high` becomes negative at any point, return false.
   - Ensure that `low` is never negative by setting it to 0 if it goes below 0.
3. After iterating through `s`, return true if `low` is 0, indicating that all '(' characters have been matched with ')' characters.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) because we use only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the characters of the string `s`, where n is the length of `s`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
        int low = 0, high = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            low += (c == '(') ? 1 : -1;
            high += (c != ')') ? 1 : -1;
            if (high < 0) return false;
            low = Math.max(low, 0);
        }
        return low == 0;
    }
}
