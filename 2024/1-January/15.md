# [Finding Winners](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-15)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The code processes the match outcomes and categorizes players based on their losses. It then creates two lists: one for players with zero losses and another for players with one loss.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**Explanation:**
1. **Losses Array:**
    - Create an array `losses` to keep track of player losses.

2. **Process Matches:**
    - Loop through each match and update the `losses` array accordingly.
    - If a player has not lost any matches (`losses[win] == 0`), set their loss status to `-1`.
    - If a player has already lost (`losses[loss] == -1`), set their loss status to `1`. Otherwise, increment their loss count.

3. **Create Result Lists:**
    - Create two lists (`zeroLoss` and `oneLoss`) to store players with zero and one loss, respectively.

4. **Populate Result Lists:**
    - Iterate through the `losses` array and add players to the appropriate lists based on their loss status.

5. **Final Result:**
    - Return a list containing the two result lists.

```java
class Solution {

    public List<List<Integer>> findWinners(int[][] matches) {
        int[] losses = new int[100001];

        for (int i = 0; i < matches.length; i++) {
            int win = matches[i][0];
            int loss = matches[i][1];

            if (losses[win] == 0) {
                losses[win] = -1;
            } 

            if (losses[loss] == -1) {
                losses[loss] = 1;
            } else {
                losses[loss]++;
            }
        }

        List<Integer> zeroLoss = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> oneLoss = new ArrayList<>();
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < losses.length; i++) {
            if (losses[i] == -1) {
                zeroLoss.add(i);
            } else if (losses[i] == 1) {
                oneLoss.add(i);
            }
        }

        result.add(zeroLoss);
        result.add(oneLoss);

        return result;
    }
}
