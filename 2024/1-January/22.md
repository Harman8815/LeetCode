# [Find the Error Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-22)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem can be solved by calculating the sum of the original sequence and the sum of the given sequence. The difference between the two sums will give the missing and repeated numbers.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
    - Initialize variables `sum` to calculate the sum of the given sequence, `asum` to calculate the sum of the original sequence, and `repeat` to store the repeated number.
    - Use a HashSet to keep track of unique numbers in the sequence.

2. **Calculate Sums:**
    - Iterate through the given sequence (`nums`).
    - Update `sum` with the sum of the given sequence.
    - If the current number is already in the HashSet, it is the repeated number; store it in the variable `repeat`.
    - Otherwise, add the number to the HashSet.

3. **Result:**
    - The missing number can be calculated as the difference between the sum of the original sequence (`asum`) and the sum of the given sequence (`sum`).
    - Return the result as an array `[repeat, missing]`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int sum = 0, asum = len * (len + 1) / 2, repeat = 0;
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
       
        for (int i : nums) {
            sum += i;
            if (set.contains(i)) 
                repeat = i;
            else
                set.add(i);
        }
        
        int[] result = new int[2];
        result[0] = repeat;
        result[1] = asum - sum + repeat;
        return result;
    }
}
