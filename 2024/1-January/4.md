[LeetCode - Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-empty/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-04)

## Intuition

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to make an array empty using two types of operations: deleting two elements with equal values or deleting three elements with equal values. The provided solution involves sorting the array, creating a frequency map, and then calculating the operations required based on the frequency of each unique element.

## Approach

1. Sort the array `nums` to group identical elements together.
2. Create a `HashMap` `map` to store the frequency of each unique element in the sorted array.
3. Iterate through the sorted array and update the frequency map.
4. Initialize a variable `ans` to 0 to store the total number of operations.
5. Iterate through the values in the frequency map:
    - If the frequency is 1, return -1 as it is not possible to perform any operation on a single element.
    - Calculate the number of operations needed for each unique element and add it to `ans`.
6. Return the final value of `ans`.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n log n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i : nums)
            map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        int ans = 0;
        for (int c: map.values()) {
            if (c == 1) {
                return -1;
            }
            ans += Math.ceil((double) c / 3);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
