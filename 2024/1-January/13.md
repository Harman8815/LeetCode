# [Minimum Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-13)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The code calculates the minimum number of steps to make two strings anagrams. It uses arrays to keep track of character frequencies in both strings and then compares the frequencies.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**Explanation:**
1. **ByteArrays:**
    - Convert both strings to byte arrays.

2. **Frequency Arrays:**
    - Create an array of size 26 to represent the frequencies of characters ('a' to 'z').
    - Iterate through both byte arrays and update the frequencies accordingly.

3. **Count Steps:**
    - Count the steps needed to make the two strings anagrams.
    - The steps are calculated by comparing the frequencies of characters.

4. **Result:**
    - Return the minimum number of steps.

```java
class Solution {

    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        byte[] sb = s.getBytes();
        byte[] tb = t.getBytes();
       
        int[] arr = new int[26];
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < sb.length; i++) {
            arr[sb[i] - 'a']++;
            arr[tb[i] - 'a']--;
        }

        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num > 0) count += num;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
