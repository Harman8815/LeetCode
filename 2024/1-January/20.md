# [Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-20)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem can be solved using a stack-based approach to find the left and right boundaries of each element in the array.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
    - Create arrays `left` and `right` to store the left and right boundaries for each element.
    - Initialize `left` with -1 and `right` with the length of the array.
    - Use a stack to maintain increasing order of elements' indices.

2. **Left Boundaries:**
    - Iterate through the array from left to right.
    - For each element, pop elements from the stack until finding an element smaller than the current one.
    - Set the left boundary for the current element as the index of the element on top of the stack.
    - Push the current index onto the stack.

3. **Right Boundaries:**
    - Iterate through the array from right to left.
    - For each element, pop elements from the stack until finding an element smaller than or equal to the current one.
    - Set the right boundary for the current element as the index of the element on top of the stack minus one.
    - Push the current index onto the stack.

4. **Calculate Sum:**
    - Iterate through the array to calculate the sum of min(b) for each subarray.
    - Use the left and right boundaries to determine the range of each subarray.
    - Update the answer with the calculated sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

5. **Result:**
    - The final answer is the sum of min(b) for all subarrays modulo 10^9 + 7.

            while (!stack.isEmpty() && arr[stack.peek()] >= arr[i]) {

                stack.pop();

                right[i] = stack.peek();
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
      
        int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        long answer = 0;
      
        for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            answer += (long) (i - left[i]) * (right[i] - i) % mod * arr[i] % mod;
            answer %= mod;
        }
