# üå°Ô∏è [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-31) | Waiting Days for Warmer Temperature ‚òÄÔ∏è

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
This code calculates the number of days one has to wait for a warmer temperature given an array of daily temperatures.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
    - `int[] answer`: Represents the array to store the number of days to wait after each day.
    
2. **Calculating Waiting Days:**
    - Loop through the array of temperatures from the second-to-last day to the first day.
    - For each day, check the next day's temperature.
    - If the next day is warmer, calculate the number of days to wait and store it in the `answer` array.
    - If there is no future day with a warmer temperature, keep `answer[i]` as 0.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(1)$$ -->

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
        int[] answer = new int[temperatures.length];

        for (int i = answer.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            int j = i + 1;
            while (temperatures[i] >= temperatures[j]) {
                j += answer[j];
                if (answer[j] == 0) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (temperatures[j] > temperatures[i]) {
                answer[i] = j - i;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
