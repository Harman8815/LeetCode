# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
This code evaluates an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). It uses a stack to keep track of operands and perform calculations based on operators.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
    - `int[] stack`: Represents the stack to store operands during evaluation.
    - `int top`: Keeps track of the top of the stack.

2. **Expression Evaluation:**
    - Loop through each token in the input array.
    - For each token, check if it is an operator ('+', '-', '*', '/').
    - Perform the corresponding operation based on the operator:
        - Addition: `a + b`
        - Subtraction: `a - b`
        - Multiplication: `a * b`
        - Division: `a / b` (Note: Division truncates toward zero)
    - If the token is not an operator, parse it as an integer and push onto the stack.

3. **Final Result:**
    - The final result is the only element left on the stack after evaluating the entire expression.

```java
class Solution {
    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        int[] stack = new int[tokens.length];
        int top = 0;

        for (String s : tokens) {
            char c = s.charAt(0);

            if (c == '+') {
                int b = stack[--top];
                int a = stack[--top];
                stack[top++] = a + b;
            } else if (c == '-' && s.length() == 1) {
                int b = stack[--top];
                int a = stack[--top];
                stack[top++] = a - b;
            } else if (c == '*') {
                int b = stack[--top];
                int a = stack[--top];
                stack[top++] = a * b;
            } else if (c == '/') {
                int b = stack[--top];
                int a = stack[--top];
                stack[top++] = a / b;
            } else
                stack[top++] = Integer.parseInt(s);
        }

        return stack[0];
    }
}
