# [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-21)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
    - Initialize two variables `p1` and `p2` to represent the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police for the current and previous houses, respectively.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
    - Iterate through the array of house amounts.
    - For each house, calculate the temporary variable `temp` to store the maximum amount from the previous house (`p2`).
    - Update `p1` to be the maximum value between the sum of the amount from the current house and the maximum amount from the previous house (`p2 + num`) and the maximum amount from the current house (`p1`).
    - Update `p2` to the temporary variable `temp`.

3. **Result:**
    - The final answer is the maximum amount that can be robbed without alerting the police, which is stored in `p1`.

        if (nums.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int p1 = 0;
        int p2 = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int temp = p1;
            p1 = Math.max(p2 + num, p1);
            p2 = temp;
        }
        return p1;
    }
}
