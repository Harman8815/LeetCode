# [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-18)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to calculate the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**Explanation:**
1. **Base Cases:**
    - If `n` is 1 or 2, return `n` as there is only one way to climb for each of these cases.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
    - Use three variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    - Iterate `n` times using a loop.
    - In each iteration, calculate `c` as the sum of `a` and `b`.
    - Update `a` and `b` accordingly.
    - Return the final value of `c`.

3. **Result:**
    - The final value of `c` represents the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(1)$$ -->

```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1 || n == 2)
            return n;
        int a = 0, b = 1, c = 0;
        while (n-- > 0) {
            c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
        return c;
    }
}
