# [Crawler Log Folder](https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-10)

## Problem Description
The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.

The operations are described below:
- `"../"`: Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
- `"./"`: Remain in the same folder.
- `"x/"`: Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).

You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.

### Example
- Input: `logs = ["d1/", "d2/", "../", "d21/", "./"]`
  Output: `2`
  Explanation: 
  - After the operations, the folder structure will be:
    - `d1/d2/` (moved to child folder `d1`)
    - `d1/` (moved to child folder `d2`)
    - `d1/` (moved up to parent folder `d2`)
    - `d1/d21/` (moved to child folder `d21`)
    - Current folder is `d1/d21/`, so we need to move up twice to reach the main folder.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Use Stack Data Structure**:
   - Utilize a stack to keep track of the current folder hierarchy.
2. **Process Each Log**:
   - If the log is `"../"`, pop the top of the stack (move up one folder) if the stack is not empty.
   - If the log is `"./"`, do nothing (remain in the current folder).
   - If the log is a folder name `"x/"`, push it onto the stack (move to the child folder).
3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The size of the stack at the end represents the number of operations needed to return to the main folder.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of operations. Each operation is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of folders in the stack.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String[] logs) {
        Stack<String> stk = new Stack<>();
        for (String log : logs) {
            if (log.equals("../")) {
                if (!stk.isEmpty()) {
                    stk.pop();
                }
            } else if (!log.equals("./")) {
                stk.push(log);
            }
        }
        return stk.size();
    }
}
