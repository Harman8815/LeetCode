# [Find the Winner of the Circular Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-the-circular-game/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-08)

## Problem Description
There are `n` friends sitting in a circle, numbered from 1 to `n`. The game proceeds as follows:
1. Start with the 1st friend.
2. Count `k` friends in the clockwise direction, including the friend you started at. This wraps around the circle.
3. The friend you land on is removed from the circle.
4. Repeat the process starting from the next friend clockwise from the one who was just removed.
5. The game continues until only one friend remains, who is the winner.

Given `n` and `k`, return the winner of the game.

### Example
- Input: `n = 5`, `k = 2`
  Output: `3`
  Explanation: The process of elimination is as follows: start at 1, count 2 (land on 2), remove 2; next start at 3, count 2 (land on 4), remove 4; next start at 5, count 2 (land on 1), remove 1; finally, only 3 and 5 remain, count 2 (land on 5), remove 5. The winner is 3.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: Use a list to represent the circle of friends.
2. **Iterative Elimination**:
   - Determine the index of the friend to remove using modulo operation to handle wrapping around the circle.
   - Update the starting index and continue until only one friend remains.
3. **Final Output**: Return the last remaining friend.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of friends. Each friend is removed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the list storing all friends.

## Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Solution {
    public int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        ArrayList<Integer> circle = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Initialize the circle with friends numbered from 1 to n.
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            circle.add(i);
        }
        
        int cur_ind = 0; // Start counting from the first friend
        
        // Continue until only one friend is left in the circle
        while (circle.size() > 1) {
            // Find the index of the friend to remove next
            int next_to_remove = (cur_ind + k - 1) % circle.size();
            circle.remove(next_to_remove); // Remove that friend
            cur_ind = next_to_remove; // Start from the next friend in the next round
        }

        // Return the only remaining friend, who is the winner
        return circle.get(0);
    }
}
