# [Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-031509)

## Problem Description
You are given an integer array `nums`. In one move, you can choose one element of `nums` and change it to any value. Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums` after performing at most three moves.

### Example:
- Input: nums = [5, 3, 2, 4]
  Output: 0
- Input: nums = [1, 5, 6, 14, 15]
  Output: 1

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the array has 4 or fewer elements, the result is `0` because you can make all the numbers equal in at most 3 moves, and the difference between the largest and smallest will be zero.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest values.
   - After sorting, the minimum difference will come from adjusting the extreme values either from the smallest or the largest, effectively limiting the range.

3. **Four Potential Moves**:
   - Since we can make at most 3 moves, we evaluate four different possibilities:
     - Option 1: Remove the three smallest numbers (change the smallest three to any value).
     - Option 2: Remove the two smallest and the largest.
     - Option 3: Remove the smallest and the two largest.
     - Option 4: Remove the three largest numbers (change the largest three to any value).

4. **Return the Minimum Difference**:
   - Compute the difference between the largest and smallest remaining values for each option and return the minimum of those.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a fixed number of variables and no additional space beyond input.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifference(int[] nums) {
        // If the array has 4 or fewer elements, return 0 as all elements can be made equal.
        if (nums.length <= 4) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Sort the array to easily find the largest and smallest values.
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;

        // Consider four possible options for minimizing the difference.
        int option1 = nums[n - 1] - nums[3];  // Remove 3 smallest numbers
        int option2 = nums[n - 2] - nums[2];  // Remove 2 smallest and the largest
        int option3 = nums[n - 3] - nums[1];  // Remove the smallest and 2 largest
        int option4 = nums[n - 4] - nums[0];  // Remove 3 largest numbers

        // Return the minimum difference.
        return Math.min(Math.min(option1, option2), Math.min(option3, option4));
    }
}
