# [Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-nodes-between-critical-points/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-05)

## Problem Description
A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima. A node is a:
- **Local maxima** if its value is strictly greater than the previous and next nodes.
- **Local minima** if its value is strictly smaller than the previous and next nodes.

A node can only be a local maxima or minima if it has both a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list, return an array of length 2 containing `[minDistance, maxDistance]`:
- `minDistance`: The minimum distance between any two distinct critical points.
- `maxDistance`: The maximum distance between any two distinct critical points.
- If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Example:
- Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
  Output: [3,3]

- Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
  Output: [1,5]

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use `minDistance` to track the smallest gap between two critical points and set it to the maximum possible integer value initially.
   - Keep track of previous critical points using indices like `previousCriticalIndex` and `firstCriticalIndex`.

2. **Traverse the List**:
   - Traverse the linked list, checking if each node is a local maxima or minima.
   - If it's the first critical point, set the `firstCriticalIndex`.
   - For every subsequent critical point, calculate the difference from the last critical point and update `minDistance`.

3. **Compute the Result**:
   - After identifying critical points, calculate the `maxDistance` as the difference between the last and first critical points.
   - If no critical points were found or only one critical point exists, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we only traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since no extra space is used except for a few variables.

## Code
```java
class Solution {

    public int[] nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(ListNode head) {
        // Initialize result array
        int[] result = { -1, -1 };

        // Initialize minimum distance to the largest possible value
        int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Pointers to track the previous node, current node, and indices
        ListNode previousNode = head;
        ListNode currentNode = head.next;
        int currentIndex = 1;
        int previousCriticalIndex = 0;
        int firstCriticalIndex = 0;

        // Traverse the list to find critical points
        while (currentNode.next != null) {
            // Check if the current node is a local maxima or minima
            if (
                (currentNode.val < previousNode.val &&
                    currentNode.val < currentNode.next.val) ||
                (currentNode.val > previousNode.val &&
                    currentNode.val > currentNode.next.val)
            ) {
                // If this is the first critical point found
                if (previousCriticalIndex == 0) {
                    previousCriticalIndex = currentIndex;
                    firstCriticalIndex = currentIndex;
                } else {
                    // Calculate the minimum distance between critical points
                    minDistance = Math.min(
                        minDistance,
                        currentIndex - previousCriticalIndex
                    );
                    previousCriticalIndex = currentIndex;
                }
            }

            // Move to the next node and update indices
            currentIndex++;
            previousNode = currentNode;
            currentNode = currentNode.next;
        }

        // If at least two critical points were found
        if (minDistance != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            int maxDistance = previousCriticalIndex - firstCriticalIndex;
            result = new int[] { minDistance, maxDistance };
        }

        return result;
    }
}
