# [Average Waiting Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-waiting-time/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-09)

## Problem Description
There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array `customers`, where `customers[i] = [arrivali, timei]`:
- `arrivali` is the arrival time of the ith customer.
- `timei` is the time needed to prepare the order of the ith customer.

The chef starts preparing the order once he is idle. The customer waits until the chef finishes preparing their order. The chef does not prepare food for more than one customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they were given in the input.

Return the average waiting time of all customers. Solutions within `10^-5` from the actual answer are considered accepted.

### Example
- Input: `customers = [[1, 2], [2, 5], [4, 3]]`
  Output: `5.0`
  Explanation: 
  - The first customer arrives at time 1 and the chef starts at 1. The preparation ends at 3. Waiting time is 2 (3 - 1).
  - The second customer arrives at time 2 and the chef starts at 3. The preparation ends at 8. Waiting time is 6 (8 - 2).
  - The third customer arrives at time 4 and the chef starts at 8. The preparation ends at 11. Waiting time is 7 (11 - 4).
  - Average waiting time is (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.0.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `current` to track when the chef is available.
   - `totalWaitTime` to accumulate the total waiting time of all customers.
2. **Process Each Customer**:
   - If the chef is idle when the customer arrives, set `current` to the arrival time of the customer.
   - Update `current` to reflect when the chef will be free after preparing the current customerâ€™s order.
   - Calculate the waiting time for the current customer and add it to `totalWaitTime`.
3. **Compute Average**:
   - Return the average waiting time as `totalWaitTime / n`, where `n` is the number of customers.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of customers. Each customer is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a few variables are used.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public double averageWaitingTime(int[][] customers) {
        int n = customers.length;
        int current = 0;
        long totalWaitTime = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int arrival = customers[i][0];
            int preparationTime = customers[i][1];

            if (current < arrival) {
                current = arrival;
            }
            current += preparationTime;
            totalWaitTime += (current - arrival);
        }
        return (double) totalWaitTime / n;
    }
}
