# [Filling Bookcase Shelves](https://leetcode.com/problems/filling-bookcase-shelves/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-31)

## Problem Description
You are given an array `books` where `books[i] = [thicknessi, heighti]` indicates the thickness and height of the `i`th book. You are also given an integer `shelfWidth`.

We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have a total width `shelfWidth`. 

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf such that the sum of their thickness is less than or equal to `shelfWidth`, then build another level of the shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down. We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.

For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.

### Example
- Input: `books = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 2]], shelfWidth = 6`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: Place the first book and the second book on the first shelf (total thickness = 3 + 2 = 5), and place the third book on the second shelf.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a 2D array `memo` to store the minimum height needed for the subproblem starting at index `i` with `remainingShelfWidth`.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a recursive function `dpHelper` that computes the minimum height of the bookshelf starting from a given book index and shelf width.
   - At each book placement, decide whether to place the book on the current shelf or start a new shelf. Compute the minimum height for both scenarios and use memoization to store the results.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When processing the last book, either place it on the current shelf or start a new shelf if necessary.

4. **Transition**:
   - If the remaining width on the shelf can accommodate the current book, consider the scenario of placing it on the current shelf.
   - Otherwise, calculate the height of the bookcase if the book is placed on a new shelf.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * w), where `n` is the number of books and `w` is the shelf width. This is due to the recursive calls and memoization.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * w), for storing the memoization table.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minHeightShelves(int[][] books, int shelfWidth) {
        // Cache to store previous computations
        int[][] memo = new int[books.length][shelfWidth + 1];
        return dpHelper(books, shelfWidth, memo, 0, shelfWidth, 0);
    }

    private int dpHelper(
        int[][] books,
        int shelfWidth,
        int[][] memo,
        int i,
        int remainingShelfWidth,
        int maxHeight
    ) {
        int[] currentBook = books[i];
        int maxHeightUpdated = Math.max(maxHeight, currentBook[1]);
        if (i == books.length - 1) {
            // For the last book, store it in the current shelf if possible,
            // or start a new shelf with it
            if (remainingShelfWidth >= currentBook[0]) return maxHeightUpdated;
            return maxHeight + currentBook[1];
        }
        // Return answer if already computed
        if (memo[i][remainingShelfWidth] != 0) {
            return memo[i][remainingShelfWidth];
        } else {
            // Calculate the height of the bookcase if we put the current book on the new shelf
            int option1Height =
                maxHeight +
                dpHelper(
                    books,
                    shelfWidth,
                    memo,
                    i + 1,
                    shelfWidth - currentBook[0],
                    currentBook[1]
                );
            if (remainingShelfWidth >= currentBook[0]) {
                // Calculate height of the bookcase if we put the current book on the current shelf
                int option2Height = dpHelper(
                    books,
                    shelfWidth,
                    memo,
                    i + 1,
                    remainingShelfWidth - currentBook[0],
                    maxHeightUpdated
                );
                // Store result in cache
                memo[i][remainingShelfWidth] = Math.min(
                    option1Height,
                    option2Height
                );
                return memo[i][remainingShelfWidth];
            }
            // Store result in cache
            memo[i][remainingShelfWidth] = option1Height;
            return memo[i][remainingShelfWidth];
        }
    }
}
