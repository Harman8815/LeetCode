# [Second Minimum Time to Reach Destination](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-time-to-reach-destination/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-282045)

## Problem Description
A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with `n` vertices where each vertex is labeled from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is `time` minutes.

Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every `change` minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.

The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.

For example, the second minimum value of `[2, 3, 4]` is 3, and the second minimum value of `[2, 2, 4]` is 4. Given `n`, `edges`, `time`, and `change`, return the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex `n`.

### Example
- Input: `n = 4`, `edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]`, `time = 3`, `change = 5`
- Output: `13`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph where each node points to its neighbors.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm with Modifications**:
   - Use a priority queue to keep track of the minimum time taken to reach each node. 
   - Maintain two arrays, `dist1` and `dist2`, where `dist1[i]` stores the minimum time to reach node `i` and `dist2[i]` stores the second minimum time.

3. **Traffic Signal Handling**:
   - Adjust the travel time based on the signal. If you arrive at a node when the signal is red, wait until the signal turns green.

4. **Update Distances**:
   - Update `dist1` and `dist2` based on the current time taken to traverse the edges. Ensure that the node is visited a maximum of two times (once for the minimum time and once for the second minimum time).

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O((E + V) log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. This is due to the priority queue operations and the graph traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E), for storing the adjacency list and distances.

        // dist1[i] stores the minimum time taken to reach node i from node 1. 
        // dist2[i] stores the second minimum time taken to reach node from node 1. 
        // freq[i] stores the number of times a node is popped out of the heap.
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dist1[i] = dist2[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> (a[1] - b[1]));

            if ((time_taken / change) % 2 == 1)
                time_taken = change * (time_taken / change + 1) + time;
            else

                    continue;

                // Update dist1 if it's more than the current time_taken and store its value in dist2 since that becomes the second minimum value now.
