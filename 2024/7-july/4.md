# [Merge Nodes in Between Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-04)

## Problem Description
You are given the head of a linked list that contains a series of integers separated by `0`s. The beginning and end of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For every two consecutive `0`s, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any `0`s.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

### Example:
- Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
  Output: [4,11]
  
- Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
  Output: [1,3,4]

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - Start by skipping the first `0`, as it is not needed for merging.
   - Use two pointers: `modify` to track where we should place the next merged sum and `nextSum` to iterate through the list.

2. **Sum Between Zeros**:
   - Traverse the list until a `0` is encountered.
   - Sum all values between two consecutive `0`s.
   
3. **Update the List**:
   - Once the sum is computed, set the current `modify` node's value to the sum.
   - Move both `modify` and `nextSum` to the next non-zero node to repeat the process for the next block.

4. **Return the Modified List**:
   - Skip the initial `0` by returning `head.next` to get the required modified list.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the list, as we need to traverse each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as the operation is performed in place without using extra space.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {

    public ListNode mergeNodes(ListNode head) {
        // Initialize a pointer to the first node after the initial 0.
        ListNode modify = head.next;
        ListNode nextSum = modify;

        // Traverse the list to sum nodes between two consecutive 0's.
        while (nextSum != null) {
            int sum = 0;

            // Accumulate values until the next 0 is found.
            while (nextSum.val != 0) {
                sum += nextSum.val;
                nextSum = nextSum.next;
            }

            // Assign the computed sum to the current modify node.
            modify.val = sum;
            
            // Move nextSum to the next block's first node (after the 0).
            nextSum = nextSum.next;
            
            // Move modify pointer to match nextSum (or next node block).
            modify.next = nextSum;
            modify = modify.next;
        }

        // Return the modified list starting after the first initial 0.
        return head.next;
    }
}
