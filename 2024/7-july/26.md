# [Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-261334)

## Problem Description
There are `n` cities numbered from 0 to `n-1`. Given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `fromi` and `toi`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most `distanceThreshold`. If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities `i` and `j` is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

### Example
- Input: `n = 4`, `edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,2,5],[1,3,4]]`, `distanceThreshold = 4`
- Output: `3`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of cities. Initialize the distance matrix with a large value (representing infinity) and set the diagonal to 0.

2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - Update the distance matrix by iterating through all possible intermediate cities and updating the shortest path distances.

3. **Determine the City**:
   - For each city, count how many cities are reachable within the `distanceThreshold`.
   - Track the city with the smallest count of reachable cities. If there's a tie, select the city with the greatest number.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^3), due to the Floyd-Warshall algorithm which processes all pairs of nodes through all possible intermediate nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), for the distance matrix.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheCity(int n, int[][] edges, int distanceThreshold) {
        int[][] distance = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(distance[i], 1000000000); // Use a large value as infinity
            distance[i][i] = 0;
        }

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            distance[edge[0]][edge[1]] = edge[2];
            distance[edge[1]][edge[0]] = edge[2];
        }

        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    distance[i][j] = Math.min(distance[i][j], distance[i][k] + distance[k][j]);
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = -1;
        int mini = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] reachable = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j && distance[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            reachable[i] = count;
            if (count <= mini) {
                mini = count;
                ans = i;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
