# [Pass the Pillow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pass-the-pillow/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-06)

## Problem Description
There are `n` people standing in a line labeled from `1` to `n`. The first person in the line initially holds a pillow. Every second, the pillow is passed to the next person. Once the pillow reaches the last person, the direction reverses, and the pillow continues passing in the opposite direction.

For example, if the pillow reaches the nth person, they pass it to the n-1th person, and then to the n-2th person, and so on.

Given two positive integers, `n` (number of people) and `time` (seconds passed), return the index of the person holding the pillow after `time` seconds.

### Example:
- Input: n = 4, time = 5  
  Output: 3  
  Explanation: After 5 seconds, the pillow reaches the 3rd person.

- Input: n = 3, time = 2  
  Output: 3  
  Explanation: After 2 seconds, the pillow reaches the 3rd person.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Track the Direction**:
   - Start by setting the direction to `1`, which means the pillow moves forward through the line.
   - Use a variable `index` to track the position of the person holding the pillow.

2. **Simulate Pillow Passing**:
   - For every second (up to `time`), update the `index` by adding the direction (`1` for forward, `-1` for backward).
   - When the pillow reaches the first or last person (`index == 1` or `index == n`), reverse the direction.

3. **Return the Final Holder**:
   - After `time` seconds, return the `index` of the person holding the pillow.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(time), since the loop runs `time` times to simulate the passing.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is used apart from a few variables.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int passThePillow(int n, int time) {
        // Initialize direction to forward (1) and index to the first person (1)
        int direction = 1;
        int index = 1;  

        // Simulate the passing of the pillow for the given time
        for (int i = 0; i < time; i++) {
            index += direction;
            
            // If the pillow reaches the last person, reverse direction to backward
            if (index == n) {
                direction = -1;
            // If the pillow reaches the first person, reverse direction to forward
            } else if (index == 1) {
                direction = 1;
            }
        }
        
        return index; // Return the final person holding the pillow
    }
}
