# [Robot Collisions](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-collisions/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-13)

## Problem Description
There are `n` 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.

You are given:
- `positions`: a 0-indexed integer array where `positions[i]` is the initial position of the i-th robot.
- `healths`: a 0-indexed integer array where `healths[i]` is the initial health of the i-th robot.
- `directions`: a string where `directions[i]` is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right, indicating the direction the i-th robot is moving.

All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.

When two robots collide:
- The robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one.
- If both robots have the same health, both are removed from the line.

Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.

### Example
- Input: `positions = [1,4,3,7,5]`, `healths = [5,2,1,4,3]`, `directions = "RLLRL"`
  Output: `[5, 3]`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialize Robots**:
   - Combine the positions, healths, and directions into a list of robots, each represented as an array containing its position, health, direction, and original index.
2. **Sort Robots**:
   - Sort the robots by their positions to process them in left-to-right order.
3. **Handle Collisions**:
   - Use a stack to track robots moving to the right ('R'). When encountering a robot moving to the left ('L'), check for collisions with robots in the stack.
   - Resolve collisions based on health and update the stack accordingly.
4. **Collect Results**:
   - After processing all robots, sort the remaining robots by their original indices and collect their healths.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of robots. Sorting and collision handling both contribute to this complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of robots. This is due to the space used by the stack and the result list.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> survivedRobotsHealths(int[] positions, int[] healths, String directions) {
        int n = positions.length;
        List<int[]> robots = new ArrayList<>();

        // Create a list of robots with their position, health, direction, and original index
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            robots.add(new int[]{positions[i], healths[i], directions.charAt(i), i});
        }

        // Sort robots by their positions
        Collections.sort(robots, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        Stack<int[]> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int[] robot : robots) {
            if (robot[2] == 'R' || stack.isEmpty() || stack.peek()[2] == 'L') {
                stack.push(robot);
                continue;
            }

            if (robot[2] == 'L') {
                boolean add = true;
                while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek()[2] == 'R' && add) {
                    int last_health = stack.peek()[1];
                    if (robot[1] > last_health) {
                        stack.pop();
                        robot[1] -= 1;
                    } else if (robot[1] < last_health) {
                        stack.peek()[1] -= 1;
                        add = false;
                    } else {
                        stack.pop();
                        add = false;
                    }
                }

                if (add) {
                    stack.push(robot);
                }
            }
        }

        // Sort remaining robots by their original index
        List<int[]> resultList = new ArrayList<>(stack);
        resultList.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[3]));

        // Collect the health of the remaining robots
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] robot : resultList) {
            result.add(robot[1]);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
