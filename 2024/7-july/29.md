# [Count Number of Teams](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-teams/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-291395)

## Problem Description
There are `n` soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value. You need to form a team of 3 soldiers from these soldiers under the following rules:

- Choose 3 soldiers with indices `(i, j, k)` and ratings `(rating[i], rating[j], rating[k])`.
- A team is valid if:
  - `(rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k])` or
  - `(rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k])`
  where `(0 <= i < j < k < n)`.

Return the number of valid teams that can be formed given the conditions. Soldiers can be part of multiple teams.

### Example
- Input: `rating = [2, 5, 3, 4, 1]`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: The valid teams are:
  - `(rating[0], rating[1], rating[2])` => `(2, 5, 3)` (decreasing sequence)
  - `(rating[0], rating[2], rating[3])` => `(2, 3, 4)` (increasing sequence)
  - `(rating[1], rating[2], rating[4])` => `(5, 3, 1)` (decreasing sequence)

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create tables `increasingTeams` and `decreasingTeams` to keep track of sequences of lengths 1, 2, and 3 for both increasing and decreasing sequences.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Iterate through each pair of soldiers and update the tables based on the current soldier's rating compared to previous soldiers.

3. **Count Valid Teams**:
   - Sum up the number of valid teams of length 3 from both tables.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of soldiers. This is due to the nested loops iterating through pairs of soldiers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), for storing the tables `increasingTeams` and `decreasingTeams`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int numTeams(int[] rating) {
        int n = rating.length;
        int teams = 0;

        // Tables for increasing and decreasing sequences
        int[][] increasingTeams = new int[n][4];
        int[][] decreasingTeams = new int[n][4];

        // Fill the base cases. (Each soldier is a sequence of length 1)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            increasingTeams[i][1] = 1;
            decreasingTeams[i][1] = 1;
        }

        // Fill the tables
        for (int count = 2; count <= 3; count++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    if (rating[j] > rating[i]) {
                        increasingTeams[j][count] +=
                        increasingTeams[i][count - 1];
                    }
                    if (rating[j] < rating[i]) {
                        decreasingTeams[j][count] +=
                        decreasingTeams[i][count - 1];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Sum up the results (All sequences of length 3)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            teams += increasingTeams[i][3] + decreasingTeams[i][3];
        }

        return teams;
    }
}
