# [Water Bottles](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-07)

## Problem Description
You are given `numBottles` full water bottles, and you can exchange `numExchange` empty bottles for one full water bottle.

Each time you drink a full water bottle, it turns into an empty bottle. You can exchange `numExchange` empty bottles for a full one. You want to maximize the number of water bottles you can drink.

Given two integers, `numBottles` (the number of initial full water bottles) and `numExchange` (the number of empty bottles required for exchange), return the **maximum number of water bottles** you can drink.

### Example:
- Input: `numBottles = 9`, `numExchange = 3`
  Output: 13  
  Explanation: You can drink 9 bottles initially. After drinking, you can exchange 9 empty bottles for 3 full bottles. After drinking these 3 bottles, you can exchange 3 empty bottles for 1 full bottle. In total, you can drink 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 bottles.

- Input: `numBottles = 15`, `numExchange = 4`
  Output: 19  
  Explanation: You can drink 15 bottles initially. After drinking, you can exchange 12 empty bottles for 3 full bottles. After drinking those 3, you have 3 more empty bottles, which you can use to exchange for another 1 full bottle. In total, you drink 15 + 3 + 1 = 19 bottles.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initial Bottles**: Start with `numBottles` full bottles. You can drink all of them.
2. **Exchange Bottles**: After drinking, you turn full bottles into empty ones. If the number of empty bottles is greater than or equal to `numExchange`, exchange them for more full bottles.
3. **Loop until Exchange Stops**: Keep exchanging empty bottles for full ones until the number of empty bottles is less than `numExchange`.
4. **Calculate Maximum Bottles**: Track the total number of bottles you can drink during the process.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(numBottles)), as each time you drink and exchange, the number of bottles reduces, and the process is repeated in logarithmic time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a few variables are used for calculations.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int totalDrank = numBottles; // Start by drinking all initial full bottles
        int emptyBottles = numBottles;

        // Continue exchanging as long as you have enough empty bottles to get more full ones
        while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
            int newBottles = emptyBottles / numExchange; // Get new full bottles
            totalDrank += newBottles; // Drink these new bottles
            emptyBottles = emptyBottles % numExchange + newBottles; // Calculate remaining empty bottles
        }

        return totalDrank; // Return the total number of bottles you can drink
    }
}
