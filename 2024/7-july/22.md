# [Sort the People](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-22)

## Problem Description
You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return `names` sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

### Example
- Input: `names = ["Mary", "John", "Bob"], heights = [180, 165, 170]`
- Output: `["Mary", "Bob", "John"]`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Mapping Heights to Names**:
   - Create a `HashMap` to associate each height with its corresponding name.

2. **Sorting Heights**:
   - Sort the `heights` array in ascending order.

3. **Constructing Result**:
   - Traverse the sorted `heights` array in reverse order and use the `HashMap` to retrieve names corresponding to these heights.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of people. The time complexity is determined by the sorting operation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the `HashMap` and result array.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String[] sortPeople(String[] names, int[] heights) {
        Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
            map.put(heights[i], names[i]);
        }
        Arrays.sort(heights);
        String[] result = new String[heights.length];
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = heights.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result[index] = map.get(heights[i]);
            index++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
