## Intuition
To find the town judge, we can count the number of people trusting each person (`trusting` array) and the number of people trusted by each person (`trusted` array). The town judge must be trusted by `n - 1` people and trust nobody.

## Approach
1. Initialize two arrays `trusting` and `trusted` of size `n + 1` to count the number of people trusting each person and the number of people trusted by each person, respectively.
2. Iterate through each trust relationship `[ai, bi]` in the `trust` array and increment the counts in `trusting` and `trusted`.
3. Iterate from 1 to `n` and check if a person is trusted by `n - 1` people and trusts nobody. Return the label of such a person as the town judge. If no such person is found, return -1.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of people. We iterate through the trust array twice.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of people. We use two arrays of size `n + 1` to store the counts.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        int[] trusting = new int[n + 1];
        int[] trusted = new int[n + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < trust.length; i++) {
            trusting[trust[i][0]]++;
            trusted[trust[i][1]]++;
        }

        int ans = -1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (trusting[i] == 0 && trusted[i] == n - 1)
                ans = i;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
