# [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-06)

## Intuition
We can group anagrams by sorting each word in the array and using the sorted word as a key in a hashmap. The value corresponding to each key will be a list of words that are anagrams of each other.

## Approach
1. Create a hashmap `map` to store the sorted word as key and a list of anagrams as value.
2. Iterate through each word in the input array `strs`.
3. Sort the characters of each word and store it in `sortedWord`.
4. Check if `sortedWord` is already a key in the `map`.
   - If not, create a new entry with `sortedWord` as the key and an empty list as the value.
   - If yes, add the current word to the list of anagrams corresponding to `sortedWord`.
5. After iterating through all words, return a new ArrayList containing all values from the `map`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n * k * log(k)), where n is the number of words in `strs` and k is the maximum length of a word in `strs`. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation.
- Space complexity: O(n * k), where n is the number of words in `strs` and k is the maximum length of a word in `strs`. The space is used to store the `map` containing the sorted words and their corresponding lists of anagrams. 

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String word : strs) {
            char[] chars = word.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars);
            String sortedWord = new String(chars);
            
            if (!map.containsKey(sortedWord)) {
                map.put(sortedWord, new ArrayList<>());
            }
            
            map.get(sortedWord).add(word);
        }
        
        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }
}
