# [Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-23)

## Intuition
To find the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We start from the `src` city and explore all possible flights. We maintain a priority queue to explore the flights with the lowest cost first. We also keep track of the number of stops to ensure we do not exceed `k` stops.

## Approach
1. Create an adjacency list `adj` to represent the flights from each city. Each entry in `adj` is a list of destinations and their corresponding prices.
2. Initialize an array `dist` to store the minimum cost to reach each city from `src`. Initialize all values in `dist` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` except for `src`, which is `0`.
3. Create a priority queue `q` to store the cities to be explored. Each element in the priority queue is an array containing the city and its total cost from `src`.
4. Add the `src` city to the priority queue with cost `0`.
5. While the priority queue is not empty and the number of stops is less than or equal to `k`:
   - Poll the top element from the priority queue.
   - If the current city does not have any flights, continue to the next iteration.
   - Iterate through each flight from the current city:
     - Calculate the total cost to reach the destination city.
     - If the total cost is less than the current cost to reach the destination city, update the cost and add the destination city to the priority queue.
   - Increment the number of stops.
6. Return the cost to reach the `dst` city. If there is no route, return `-1`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(V + E * log V), where V is the number of vertices (cities) and E is the number of edges (flights). The priority queue operations dominate the time complexity.
- Space complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (cities) and E is the number of edges (flights). The space is used for the adjacency list, distance array, and priority queue.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int findCheapestPrice(int n, int[][] flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        Map<Integer, List<int[]>> adj = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] flight : flights) {
            adj.computeIfAbsent(flight[0], key -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new int[] {flight[1], flight[2]});
        }

        int[] dist = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[src] = 0;

        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(new int[] {src, 0});
        int stops = 0;

        while (!q.isEmpty() && stops <= k) {
            int sz = q.size();
            while (sz-- > 0) {
                int[] curr = q.poll();
                int node = curr[0];
                int distance = curr[1];

                if (!adj.containsKey(node)) continue;

                for (int[] next : adj.get(node)) {
                    int neighbour = next[0];
                    int price = next[1];
                    if (price + distance >= dist[neighbour]) continue;
                    dist[neighbour] = price + distance;
                    q.offer(new int[] {neighbour, dist[neighbour]});
                }
            }
            stops++;
        }

        return dist[dst] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : dist[dst];
    }
}
