# [Most Booked Room](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-18)

## Intuition
To find the room that held the most meetings, we can iterate through the meetings sorted by start time. For each meeting, we try to allocate it to the room with the earliest available time. If no room is available, we allocate it to the room that will be available earliest. We maintain an array `times` to track the end time of each room's current meeting and an array `ans` to track the number of meetings each room has held.

## Approach
1. Sort the meetings array by start time.
2. Initialize an array `ans` of size `n` to track the number of meetings each room has held.
3. Initialize an array `times` of size `n` to track the end time of each room's current meeting.
4. Iterate through each meeting in the sorted meetings array:
   - Find the earliest available room (room with the earliest end time).
   - If no room is available, find the room that will be available earliest and allocate the meeting to that room.
   - Update the end time of the allocated room and increment the number of meetings held by that room.
5. Find the room that held the most meetings (`maxi`) and return its number (`id`).

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of meetings. In the worst case, for each meeting, we may need to iterate through all rooms to find the earliest available room.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rooms. We use arrays to track the number of meetings and the end times of meetings for each room.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int mostBooked(int n, int[][] meetings) {
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        long[] times = new long[n];
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        for (int i = 0; i < meetings.length; i++) {
            int start = meetings[i][0], end = meetings[i][1];
            boolean flag = false;
            int minind = -1;
            long val = Long.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (times[j] < val) {
                    val = times[j];
                    minind = j;
                }
                if (times[j] <= start) {
                    flag = true;
                    ans[j]++;
                    times[j] = end;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!flag) {
                ans[minind]++;
                times[minind] += (end - start);
            }
        }

        int maxi = -1, id = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (ans[i] > maxi) {
                maxi = ans[i];
                id = i;
            }
        }
        return id;
    }
}
