# [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-05)

## Intuition
We can solve this problem using the sliding window technique. We maintain a window that contains all characters of string t. We then expand the window until all characters of t are included. Once we have a valid window, we contract the window from the left to minimize its size while still maintaining the inclusion of all characters of t.

## Approach
**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
    - Initialize variables `start` and `end` to keep track of the window.
    - Initialize variable `count` to keep track of the number of characters of t remaining to be included in the window.
    - Initialize an array `map` to store the count of characters in t.

2. **Sliding Window:**
    - Move the `end` pointer to include more characters from s into the window.
    - If the character at `end` is a character in t, decrement its count in `map` and decrement `count`.
    - When `count` becomes 0, all characters of t are included in the window.

3. **Contracting Window:**
    - Move the `start` pointer to minimize the window size while still maintaining the inclusion of all characters of t.
    - If the character at `start` is a character in t, increment its count in `map` and increment `count`.
    - Update the minimum window length and the start index if a smaller window is found.

4. **Result:**
    - Return the minimum window substring from `startIndex` with length `minLen`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m + n)  <!-- m is the length of string s and n is the length of string t -->
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(m + n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)  <!-- The map array has a constant size of 128 -->
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(1)$$ -->

```java
class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        if (s == null || t == null || s.length() == 0 || t.length() == 0 ||
                s.length() < t.length()) {
            return "";
        }
        int[] map = new int[128];
        int count = t.length();
        int start = 0, end = 0, minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE, startIndex = 0;
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            map[c]++;
        }
        char[] chS = s.toCharArray();
        while (end < chS.length) {
            if (map[chS[end++]]-- > 0) {
                count--;
            }
            while (count == 0) {
                if (end - start < minLen) {
                    startIndex = start;
                    minLen = end - start;
                }
                if (map[chS[start++]]++ == 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return minLen == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : new String(chS, startIndex, minLen);
    }
}
