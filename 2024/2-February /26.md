# [Check if Two Binary Trees are the Same](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-26)

## Intuition
To check if two binary trees are the same, we can perform a recursive comparison of their nodes. At each step, we check if the current nodes are both null (indicating the end of the tree) or if their values are equal. If they are not equal or one node is null while the other is not, we return false. Otherwise, we recursively check the left and right subtrees.

## Approach
1. If both trees are empty, they are the same, so return true.
2. If one tree is empty while the other is not, they are not the same, so return false.
3. If the values of the current nodes are not equal, the trees are not the same, so return false.
4. Recursively check if the left subtrees are the same and if the right subtrees are the same.
5. If both recursive calls return true, the trees are the same, so return true; otherwise, return false.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(min(n, m)), where n and m are the number of nodes in the two trees. This is because we traverse each node once.
- Space complexity: O(min(h1, h2)), where h1 and h2 are the heights of the two trees. This is the space used by the recursion stack, which is at most the height of the smaller tree.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (p == null && q == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if (p == null || q == null || p.val != q.val) {
            return false;
        }
        return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}
