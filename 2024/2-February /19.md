# [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-19)

## Intuition
To determine if an integer `n` is a power of two, we can repeatedly divide `n` by 2 until it becomes 1 or the remainder is not 0. If `n` becomes 1 at the end of the division, it is a power of two; otherwise, it is not.

## Approach
1. If `n` is less than 1, return false.
2. If `n` is equal to 1, return true.
3. If the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not 0, return false.
4. Recursively call the function with `n / 2`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(log n), where n is the input integer. The function is called recursively log n times.
- Space complexity: O(log n), where n is the input integer. The space is used for the recursive call stack.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n < 1)
            return false;
        if (n == 1)
            return true;
        if (n % 2 != 0)
            return false;
        else
            return isPowerOfTwo(n / 2);
    }
}
