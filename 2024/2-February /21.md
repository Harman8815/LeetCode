# [Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-21)

## Intuition
To find the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range `[left, right]`, we can iteratively shift both `left` and `right` to the right until they are equal. The number of shifts (`cnt`) gives the common prefix of all numbers in the range. We then left shift `left` by `cnt` to obtain the result.

## Approach
1. Initialize a variable `cnt` to 0.
2. While `left` is not equal to `right`:
   - Right shift `left` and `right` by 1 bit.
   - Increment `cnt` by 1.
3. Return the result of left shifting `left` by `cnt`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(log n), where n is the maximum value in the range `[left, right]`. The number of iterations is determined by the number of bits in `n`.
- Space complexity: O(1).

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (left != right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            cnt++;
        }
        return (left << cnt);
    }
}
