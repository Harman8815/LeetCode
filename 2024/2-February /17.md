## Intuition
To find the furthest building index you can reach using the given ladders and bricks optimally, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the height differences between consecutive buildings. We iterate through the buildings and for each pair of consecutive buildings, we calculate the height difference. If the height difference is positive (i.e., the next building is taller), we subtract the difference from the available bricks. If the bricks are not enough, we use a ladder by adding the difference to the priority queue and subtracting the highest difference from the bricks. If there are no more ladders left, we break out of the loop.

## Approach
1. Initialize a priority queue `p` to store the height differences in descending order.
2. Iterate through each building height `h[i]` in `h` up to the second last building:
   - Calculate the height difference `diff` between `h[i]` and `h[i+1]`.
   - If `diff` is less than or equal to 0, continue to the next building.
   - Subtract `diff` from `b` (available bricks).
   - Add `diff` to the priority queue `p`.
   - If `b` becomes negative, use a ladder by adding the highest difference from `p` to `b` and removing it from `p`.
   - If there are no more ladders left (`l` is negative), break out of the loop.
3. Return the furthest building index reached (`i`).

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log k), where n is the number of buildings and k is the number of ladders. The priority queue operations take O(log k) time and we iterate through each building once.
- Space complexity: O(k), where k is the number of ladders. The space is used for the priority queue.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int furthestBuilding(int[] h, int b, int l) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> p = new PriorityQueue<>((a, c) -> c - a);

        int i = 0, diff = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < h.length - 1; i++) {
            diff = h[i + 1] - h[i];

            if (diff <= 0) {
                continue;
            }

            b -= diff;
            p.offer(diff);

            if (b < 0) {
                b += p.poll();
                l--;
            }

            if (l < 0) {
                break;
            }
        }

        return i;
    }
}
