## Intuition
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a 3D array `dp` to store the maximum number of cherries that can be collected up to a certain point `(i, j)` for both robots. We start from the top row and move down, considering all possible paths for both robots. For each cell `(i, j)`, we calculate the maximum cherries that can be collected by either robot starting from `(0, 0)` and `(0, cols - 1)` respectively and reaching `(i, j)`.

## Approach
1. Initialize a 3D array `dp` of size `m x n x n` where `m` is the number of rows, and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. Initialize all values in `dp` to -1.
2. Initialize `ans` to 0.
3. Initialize `dp[0][0][n-1]` to `grid[0][0] + grid[0][n-1]` as the maximum cherries collected by both robots at the top row.
4. Iterate from the second row `i=1` to the last row `i=m-1`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid:
     - Iterate over all possible positions for both robots in the previous row `(i-1, j1)` and `(i-1, j2)`.
       - Update `dp[i][j1][j2]` to the maximum of its current value and the maximum value of `dp[i-1][j1'][j2']` where `(j1', j2')` are valid positions that can reach `(j1, j2)`.
       - Add the cherries in the current cell to the maximum value.
       - Update `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i][j1][j2]`.
5. Return `ans`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m * n^2), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. We iterate through each cell in the grid, and for each cell, we iterate over all possible positions for both robots in the previous row, which is O(n^2).
- Space complexity: O(m * n^2), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. The 3D array `dp` stores the maximum cherries that can be collected up to each cell for both robots.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int cherryPickup(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;

        int[][][] dp = new int[m][n][n];
        int ans = 0;

        for(int i=0;i<m;i++)
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
                Arrays.fill(dp[i][j], -1);

        dp[0][0][n-1] = grid[0][0] + grid[0][n-1];

        for(int i=1;i<m;i++) {
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++) { // robotA
                for(int k=j+1;k<n;k++) { // robotB
                    int max = -1;
                    for(int x=-1;x<=1;x++) { // we will have total 9 combinations
                        for(int y=-1;y<=1;y++) {
                            if(j+x >= 0 && j+x < n && k+y >= 0 && k+y < n)
                                max = Math.max(
                                    max,
                                    dp[i-1][j+x][k+y]
                                );
                        }
                    }
                    if(max != -1)
                        dp[i][j][k] = max + grid[i][j] + grid[i][k];
                    if(ans < dp[i][j][k]) ans = dp[i][j][k];
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
