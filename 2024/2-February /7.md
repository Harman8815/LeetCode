# [Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-07)

## Intuition
We can use a HashMap to store the frequency of each character in the string. Then, we can use a PriorityQueue to sort the characters based on their frequencies in decreasing order. Finally, we can construct the sorted string by appending each character the number of times it appears in the PriorityQueue.

## Approach
1. Create a HashMap `hm` to store the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
2. Iterate through each character in `s` and update its frequency in `hm`.
3. Create a PriorityQueue `pq` and add all entries from `hm` to `pq`, sorting them based on frequency in decreasing order.
4. Create a StringBuilder `result` to store the sorted string.
5. While `pq` is not empty, poll the entry with the highest frequency from `pq` and append the character to `result` the number of times equal to its frequency.
6. Return the sorted string as a string.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation of the PriorityQueue.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. The space is used to store the HashMap `hm` and the PriorityQueue `pq`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            hm.put(c, hm.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        PriorityQueue<Map.Entry<Character, Integer>> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(
            (a, b) -> b.getValue() - a.getValue()
        );
        
        pq.addAll(hm.entrySet());
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Map.Entry<Character, Integer> entry = pq.poll();
            result.append(String.valueOf(entry.getKey()).repeat(entry.getValue()));
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```
