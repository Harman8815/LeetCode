# [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-12)

## Intuition
The majority element is the element that appears more than half the time in the array. One way to find it is by sorting the array and returning the middle element, as it will be the majority element due to the given assumption. This is because the majority element appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times, where n is the length of the array.

## Approach
1. Sort the input array `nums`.
2. Return the element at index `nums.length/2`, as it will be the majority element.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation.
- Space complexity: O(1). Sorting is done in place, and no extra space is used.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums[nums.length/2];
    }
}
