# [Even-Odd Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/even-odd-tree/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-29)

## Intuition
To check if a binary tree is Even-Odd, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) and keep track of the previous value seen at each level. 
For even-indexed levels, we ensure that the nodes have odd values in increasing order. 
For odd-indexed levels, we ensure that the nodes have even values in decreasing order.

## Approach
1. Initialize a list `prev` to keep track of the previous value seen at each level.
2. Perform a DFS on the tree, passing the current node and its level as parameters.
3. If the current node is null, return true.
4. Check if the value of the current node violates the Even-Odd conditions based on its level.
5. Update the `prev` list with the current node's value.
6. Recursively call the function for the left and right children of the current node with an increased level.
7. Return the result of the DFS.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the recursion stack.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    private List<Integer> prev = new ArrayList<>();

    public boolean isEvenOddTree(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode current = root;
        return dfs(current, 0);
    }

    private boolean dfs(TreeNode current, int level) {
        if (current == null) 
            return true;

        if (current.val % 2 == level % 2) 
            return false;

        while (prev.size() <= level) 
            prev.add(0);

        if (prev.get(level) != 0 &&
            ((level % 2 == 0 && current.val <= prev.get(level)) ||
            (level % 2 == 1 && current.val >= prev.get(level)))) 
            return false;

        prev.set(level, current.val);

        return dfs(current.left, level + 1) && dfs(current.right, level + 1);
    }
}
