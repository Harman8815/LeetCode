# [Rearrange Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-elements-by-sign/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-14)

## Intuition
To rearrange an array `nums` of even length such that every consecutive pair of integers has opposite signs, we can first separate the positive and negative integers into two separate ArrayLists. Then, we can reconstruct the array by alternately adding positive and negative integers from their respective lists.

## Approach
1. Initialize two ArrayLists `pos` and `neg` to store positive and negative integers from `nums` respectively.
2. Iterate through each element `i` in `nums`:
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, add it to `pos`.
   - Otherwise, add its absolute value to `neg`.
3. Initialize two variables `a` and `b` to 0 to keep track of the current indices in `pos` and `neg` respectively.
4. Iterate through each index `i` in `nums`:
   - Set `nums[i]` to `pos.get(a++)`.
   - Increment `i`.
   - Set `nums[i]` to `-neg.get(b++)`.
5. Return `nums` as the rearranged array.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. We iterate through `nums` twice, once to separate positive and negative integers, and once to reconstruct the array.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. The space is used to store the positive and negative integers in separate ArrayLists.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        ArrayList<Integer> pos = new ArrayList<>();
        ArrayList<Integer> neg = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i >= 0) {
                pos.add(i);
            } else {
                neg.add(Math.abs(i));
            }
        }
        
        int a = 0, b = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            nums[i] = pos.get(a++);
            i++;
            nums[i] = -neg.get(b++);
        }
        
        return nums;
    }
}
