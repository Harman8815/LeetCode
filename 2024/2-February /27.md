# [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-27)

## Intuition
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

## Approach
1. We can calculate the diameter of a binary tree by finding the height of each node's left and right subtrees and summing them.
2. For each node, we calculate the height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree.
3. The diameter passing through the current node is the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees plus 1 (to account for the current node).
4. We update the overall diameter if the current node's diameter is greater.
5. Finally, we return the overall diameter minus 1 (to remove the extra edge counted at the root).

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the recursion stack, which is at most the height of the tree.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    int diameter = 0;

    public int height(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        int left = height(root.left);
        int right = height(root.right);
        int dia = left + right + 1;
        diameter = Math.max(dia, diameter);
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }

    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        height(root);
        return diameter - 1;
    }
}
