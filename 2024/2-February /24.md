# [Find All People Who Know the Secret](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-people-with-secret/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-24)

## Intuition
We can represent the meetings between people as a graph, where each person is a node and each meeting is an edge. We can use a BFS traversal starting from the person who initially knows the secret (`firstPerson`) to find all people who eventually know the secret.

## Approach
1. Create a graph where each person (`x`) has a list of meetings (`time`, `y`) with other people (`y`).
2. Initialize an array `earliest` to store the earliest time each person knows the secret. Initialize all values to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` except for `0` and `firstPerson`, which are set to `0`.
3. Create a queue `q` to perform BFS. Each element in the queue is a pair (`person`, `time`).
4. Add the initial person (`0`) and `firstPerson` to the queue with time `0`.
5. While the queue is not empty, pop a person and time from the queue. For each meeting the person has (`t`, `nextPerson`), if `t` is greater than or equal to the current time and `earliest[nextPerson]` is greater than `t`, update `earliest[nextPerson]` to `t` and add `nextPerson` to the queue.
6. After BFS, iterate through the `earliest` array and add the indices of people with `earliest[i]` not equal to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to the result list.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of people and E is the number of meetings. The BFS traversal visits each person and meeting once.
- Space complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of people and E is the number of meetings. The graph and queue can store up to O(V + E) elements.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findAllPeople(int n, int[][] meetings, int firstPerson) {
        Map<Integer, List<int[]>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] meeting : meetings) {
            int x = meeting[0], y = meeting[1], t = meeting[2];
            graph.computeIfAbsent(x, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new int[]{t, y});
            graph.computeIfAbsent(y, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new int[]{t, x});
        }

        int[] earliest = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(earliest, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        earliest[0] = 0;
        earliest[firstPerson] = 0;

        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(new int[]{0, 0});
        q.offer(new int[]{firstPerson, 0});

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int[] personTime = q.poll();
            int person = personTime[0], time = personTime[1];
            for (int[] nextPersonTime : graph.getOrDefault(person, new ArrayList<>())) {
                int t = nextPersonTime[0], nextPerson = nextPersonTime[1];
                if (t >= time && earliest[nextPerson] > t) {
                    earliest[nextPerson] = t;
                    q.offer(new int[]{nextPerson, t});
                }
            }
        }

        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (earliest[i] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                ans.add(i);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
