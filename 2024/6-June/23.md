## Intuition
We need to find the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to a given `limit`. Using two deques (double-ended queues), we can efficiently track the maximum and minimum values within the current window to maintain this property.

## Approach
1. **Two Deques Approach**:
   - Use `increase` deque to track maximum values in non-increasing order.
   - Use `decrease` deque to track minimum values in non-decreasing order.
   
2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Initialize `left` pointer to mark the start of the current window.
   - Iterate through the array:
     - Add each element to `increase` and `decrease` deques, adjusting them to maintain their respective orders.
     - Check if the absolute difference between the minimum (`decrease.getFirst()`) and maximum (`increase.getFirst()`) values in the current window exceeds `limit`.
     - If it does, move the `left` pointer to the right until the condition is satisfied.
     - Calculate the size of the current valid subarray (`i - left + 1`) and update `max` with the maximum size found.

3. **Result**:
   - Return `max`, which represents the size of the longest subarray found.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. Each element is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the deques used to store up to `n` elements in the worst case.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums, int limit) {
        LinkedList<Integer> increase = new LinkedList<>();
        LinkedList<Integer> decrease = new LinkedList<>();
        
        int max = 0;
        int left = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int n = nums[i];
            
            while (!increase.isEmpty() && n < increase.getLast()) {
                increase.removeLast();
            }
            increase.add(n);
            
            while (!decrease.isEmpty() && n > decrease.getLast()) {
                decrease.removeLast();
            }
            decrease.add(n);
            
            while (decrease.getFirst() - increase.getFirst() > limit) {
                if (nums[left] == increase.getFirst()) {
                    increase.removeFirst();
                }
                if (nums[left] == decrease.getFirst()) {
                    decrease.removeFirst();
                }
                left++;
            }
            
            int size = i - left + 1;
            max = Math.max(max, size);
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

This solution efficiently finds the longest continuous subarray with the absolute difference constraint using a sliding window approach with two deques to maintain the required conditions.
