# [Find Center of Star Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-27)
### Problem Explanation
You are given an undirected star graph with `n` nodes labeled from 1 to `n`. A star graph consists of one central node that is connected to all other nodes (exactly `n - 1` edges in total).

### Approach
1. **Degree Counting**: Use a `HashMap` to count the degree (number of connections) for each node based on the given edges.
2. **Identifying the Center**: The center node of the star graph will be the node whose degree equals `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of nodes.

### Implementation
Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findCenter(int[][] edges) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> degree = new HashMap<>();

        // Count degrees for each node
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            degree.put(edge[0], degree.getOrDefault(edge[0], 0) + 1);
            degree.put(edge[1], degree.getOrDefault(edge[1], 0) + 1);
        }

        // Find the node with degree (edges.length)
        int n = edges.length + 1; // Total nodes
        for (int node : degree.keySet()) {
            if (degree.get(node) == n - 1) {
                return node;
            }
        }

        return -1; // Should not reach here according to the problem statement
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Degree Map**: The `degree` map stores each node's degree (number of connections).
- **Counting Degrees**: Iterate through each edge to increment the degree count for both nodes involved in the edge.
- **Finding the Center**: Iterate through the degree map to find the node whose degree is `n - 1`, where `n` is the total number of nodes (`edges.length + 1`). This node is the center of the star graph.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(E), where E is the number of edges. This is because we iterate through each edge to update the degree map.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes. This is due to the space used by the degree map.

This solution efficiently finds the center of the star graph using degree counting, ensuring correctness based on the properties of a star graph described in the problem statement.
