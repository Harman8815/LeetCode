# [Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-13)

## Intuition
The goal is to seat each student such that the total number of moves is minimized. By sorting both the seats and students, we can directly pair each student with the closest available seat, minimizing the total movement.

## Approach
1. Sort the `seats` array and the `students` array.
2. Initialize a variable `moves` to 0 to store the total moves.
3. Iterate through the arrays, and for each index `i`, calculate the absolute difference between `seats[i]` and `students[i]`.
4. Add this difference to `moves`.
5. Return `moves` as the final result.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n), due to the sorting of the arrays.
- Space complexity: O(1), using a constant amount of additional space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minMovesToSeat(int[] seats, int[] students) {
        Arrays.sort(seats);
        Arrays.sort(students);
        int moves = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
            moves += Math.abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        }
        return moves;
    }
}
```
