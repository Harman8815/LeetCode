## Problem Description
Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of n nodes and three types of edges:
- Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
- Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
- Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array edges where edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge of type typei between nodes ui and vi, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.

Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return -1 if Alice and Bob cannot fully traverse the graph.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Use two instances of Union-Find data structures (`UnionFind`), one for Alice and one for Bob.
   - Initialize with each node as its own component.

2. **Union Operations**:
   - For edges of type 3 (traversable by both), perform unions in both Alice's and Bob's Union-Find structures.
   - For edges of type 1 (traversable by Alice only) and type 2 (traversable by Bob only), perform unions in the respective Union-Find structures.

3. **Count Required Edges**:
   - Track the total number of edges required (`edgesRequired`) for both Union-Find structures combined.

4. **Check Connectivity**:
   - After processing all edges, check if both Alice's and Bob's Union-Find structures are connected (i.e., all nodes are in the same component).
   - If connected, calculate the maximum number of removable edges as `edges.length - edgesRequired`.
   - If not connected, return `-1` indicating it's impossible for Alice and Bob to fully traverse the graph.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(E * α(V)), where E is the number of edges, V is the number of vertices, and α is the inverse Ackermann function (very slow-growing). The complexity primarily comes from the union operations with path compression.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), where V is the number of vertices for storing Union-Find data structures.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxNumEdgesToRemove(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Different UnionFind instances for Alice and Bob.
        UnionFind Alice = new UnionFind(n);
        UnionFind Bob = new UnionFind(n);

        int edgesRequired = 0;
        
        // Perform union for edges of type = 3, for both Alice and Bob.
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            if (edge[0] == 3) {
                edgesRequired += (Alice.performUnion(edge[1], edge[2]) | Bob.performUnion(edge[1], edge[2]));
            }
        }

        // Perform union for Alice if type = 1 and for Bob if type = 2.
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            if (edge[0] == 1) {
                edgesRequired += Alice.performUnion(edge[1], edge[2]);
            } else if (edge[0] == 2) {
                edgesRequired += Bob.performUnion(edge[1], edge[2]);
            }
        }

        // Check if both Alice and Bob's UnionFind have all nodes in a single component.
        if (Alice.isConnected() && Bob.isConnected()) {
            return edges.length - edgesRequired;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }

    private class UnionFind {
        int[] parent;
        int[] size;
        int components;

        public UnionFind(int n) {
            parent = new int[n + 1];
            size = new int[n + 1];
            components = n;

            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
                size[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        public int find(int p) {
            if (parent[p] != p) {
                parent[p] = find(parent[p]); // Path compression
            }
            return parent[p];
        }

        public boolean union(int p, int q) {
            int rootP = find(p);
            int rootQ = find(q);
            if (rootP == rootQ) return false;

            if (size[rootP] > size[rootQ]) {
                parent[rootQ] = rootP;
                size[rootP] += size[rootQ];
            } else {
                parent[rootP] = rootQ;
                size[rootQ] += size[rootP];
            }
            components--;
            return true;
        }

        public boolean isConnected() {
            return components == 1;
        }
    }
}
```

This solution effectively determines the maximum number of edges that can be removed to ensure both Alice and Bob can fully traverse the graph using Union-Find data structures, optimizing edge removal for different types of traversal permissions.
