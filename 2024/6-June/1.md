# [Score of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-a-string/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-01)

## Intuition
The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters. We can iterate through the string and calculate the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent characters.

## Approach
1. Initialize a variable `ans` to 0 to store the score.
2. Iterate through the string starting from index 1.
3. For each character at index `i`, calculate the absolute difference between it and the character at index `i-1`, and add it to `ans`.
4. Return `ans` as the final score.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once.
- Space complexity: O(1), using only a fixed amount of additional space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int scoreOfString(String s) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            ans += Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i - 1));
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
