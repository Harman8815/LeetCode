# [Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-make-m-bouquets/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-19)

## Intuition
To determine the minimum number of days needed to make m bouquets with k adjacent flowers each from a garden where each flower blooms on a specific day, we can use a binary search approach on the days. We check if it's possible to make at least m bouquets on a given day and adjust our search range accordingly.

## Approach
1. **Binary Search Setup**: Initialize `start` as the minimum day (`0`) and `end` as the maximum day from `bloomDay`.
2. **Helper Function**: `getNumOfBouquets(mid, k)` calculates the number of bouquets that can be made if we assume flowers bloom on day `mid`.
   - Iterate through `bloomDay`, counting consecutive flowers that bloom on or before `mid`.
   - Reset the count when encountering flowers that bloom after `mid`, and increment the bouquet count when `k` consecutive flowers are counted.
3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - Adjust `start` or `end` based on whether the current `mid` allows making at least `m` bouquets.
4. **Result**: Return `start` when `start` equals `end`, indicating the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets. If `m` bouquets cannot be made with any day, return `-1`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log d)\), where `n` is the number of flowers and `d` is the difference between `start` and `end` in binary search, because `getNumOfBouquets(mid, k)` is linear in terms of `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we only use a constant amount of additional space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDays(int[] bloomDay, int m, int k) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        for (int day : bloomDay) {
            end = Math.max(end, day);
        }

        int minDays = -1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (canMakeBouquets(bloomDay, mid, k) >= m) {
                minDays = mid;
                end = mid - 1;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return minDays;
    }

    private int canMakeBouquets(int[] bloomDay, int day, int k) {
        int bouquets = 0;
        int flowers = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < bloomDay.length; i++) {
            if (bloomDay[i] <= day) {
                flowers++;
                if (flowers == k) {
                    bouquets++;
                    flowers = 0;
                }
            } else {
                flowers = 0;
            }
        }

        return bouquets;
    }
}
```

This solution effectively uses binary search to minimize the number of days required to make `m` bouquets with `k` adjacent flowers each, ensuring efficiency and correctness.
