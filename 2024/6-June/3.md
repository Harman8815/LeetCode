# [Minimum Characters to Append to Make String t a Subsequence of String s](https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-03)

## Intuition
To make string `t` a subsequence of string `s`, we can iterate over both strings and keep track of the matching characters in `s` with characters in `t`. The number of characters left in `t` after the iteration represents the minimum characters needed to be appended to `s`.

## Approach
1. Initialize a counter `e` to 0 to track the index of the next character to match in string `t`.
2. Iterate over string `s`.
   - If the current character in `s` matches the character at index `e` in `t`, increment `e`.
3. Return the remaining length of `t` after the iteration, which represents the minimum characters needed to be appended to `s`.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of string `s`. We iterate over `s` once.
- Space complexity: O(1). We use only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
class Solution {
    public int appendCharacters(String s, String t) {
        int e=0;
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++){
            if(e < t.length() && s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(e)) {
                e++;
            }
        }
        return t.length() - e;
    }
}
