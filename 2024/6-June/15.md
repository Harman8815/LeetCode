## Intuition
To maximize the capital after completing up to `k` projects, we should always choose the project with the highest profit that can be started with the current available capital. By using a max-heap, we can efficiently track the most profitable projects that are affordable.

## Approach
1. Define a `Project` class to hold `capital` and `profit` for each project.
2. Create a list of `Project` objects from the given `profits` and `capital` arrays.
3. Sort the projects by their capital requirement in ascending order.
4. Use a max-heap to store the profits of projects that can be started with the current capital.
5. Iterate up to `k` times, and for each iteration:
   - Add all projects that can be started with the current capital to the max-heap.
   - If no projects can be started, break the loop.
   - Select the project with the highest profit from the max-heap and add its profit to the total capital.
6. Return the total capital after completing the projects.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n + k log n), due to sorting the projects and heap operations.
- Space complexity: O(n), for storing the projects and the max-heap.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    private static class Project {
        int capital;
        int profit;

        Project(int capital, int profit) {
            this.capital = capital;
            this.profit = profit;
        }
    }

    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        int n = profits.length;
        List<Project> projects = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            projects.add(new Project(capital[i], profits[i]));
        }

        Collections.sort(projects, (a, b) -> a.capital - b.capital);
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((x, y) -> y - x);
        int i = 0;

        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            while (i < n && projects.get(i).capital <= w) {
                maxHeap.add(projects.get(i).profit);
                i++;
            }

            if (maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
                break;
            }

            w += maxHeap.poll();
        }

        return w;
    }
}
```
