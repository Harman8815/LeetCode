# [All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-29)

## Problem Description
You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from fromi to toi in the graph.

Return a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.

A node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Build an adjacency list representation of the DAG using an array of ArrayLists.

2. **DFS for Ancestors**:
   - Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) for each node to find all nodes that can reach it (ancestors). During DFS, record the ancestors and ensure they are added to the correct node's list.

3. **Sorting Ancestors**:
   - Sort the list of ancestors for each node in ascending order as required.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges. This is because each edge and node is processed once during DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m), for storing the graph and recursion stack.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> getAncestors(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        ArrayList<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dfs(graph, i, i, res, new boolean[n]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res.get(i).sort(Integer::compareTo);
        }

        return res;
    }

    private void dfs(ArrayList<Integer>[] graph, int parent, int curr, List<List<Integer>> res, boolean[] visit) {
        visit[curr] = true;
        for (int dest : graph[curr]) {
            if (!visit[dest]) {
                res.get(dest).add(parent);
                dfs(graph, parent, dest, res, visit);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This solution effectively computes the list of ancestors for each node in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using DFS, ensuring the results are sorted as required.
