## Intuition
We need to sort the array in-place such that the colors (0, 1, and 2) are arranged in the order red, white, and blue. This can be achieved using the Dutch National Flag algorithm, which partitions the array into three sections: less than 1, equal to 1, and greater than 1.

## Approach
1. Initialize three pointers: `l` for the left boundary (red), `r` for the right boundary (blue), and `i` for the current element.
2. Iterate through the array with the current pointer `i`:
   - If `nums[i]` is 0 (red), swap it with the element at the left boundary and move both `i` and `l` forward.
   - If `nums[i]` is 1 (white), just move `i` forward.
   - If `nums[i]` is 2 (blue), swap it with the element at the right boundary and move the right boundary backward.
3. The array will be sorted in-place after the iteration.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are sorting in-place without using extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length - 1;

        for (int i = 0; i <= r;)
            if (nums[i] == 0)
                swap(nums, i++, l++);
            else if (nums[i] == 1)
                ++i;
            else
                swap(nums, i, r--);
    }

    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        final int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
