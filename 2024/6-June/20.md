# [Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-20)

## Problem Explanation
In this problem, we need to distribute `m` balls into `n` baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximized. The magnetic force between two balls at positions `x` and `y` is defined as `|x - y|`.

## Approach
To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Sorting**: Start by sorting the array `position`, which gives us a sorted list of basket positions.
2. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to find the maximum possible minimum distance (`d`) between balls such that we can place all `m` balls in the baskets.
3. **Checking Feasibility**: For a given distance `d` (mid in binary search):
   - Place the first ball in the first basket (`position[0]`).
   - Place subsequent balls in the next basket that is at least `d` distance away from the last placed ball.
   - Continue until all balls are placed or no more valid positions are found.
4. **Adjusting Search Range**: 
   - If placing all balls is possible with distance `d`, then try for a larger distance (`lo = mid + 1`).
   - If not possible, reduce the distance (`hi = mid - 1`).
5. **Result**: The maximum distance `d` found during the binary search is the answer.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log(\text{maxRange}))\), where `n` is the number of baskets (`position.length`) and `maxRange` is the maximum possible distance (`position[position.length-1] - position[0]`).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] position, int m) {
        Arrays.sort(position);
        int lo = 1;
        int hi = (position[position.length - 1] - position[0]) / (m - 1);
        int ans = 1;
        
        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (canPlace(position, mid, m)) {
                ans = mid;
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
    
    private boolean canPlace(int[] position, int dist, int m) {
        int count = 1;
        int lastPosition = position[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < position.length; i++) {
            if (position[i] - lastPosition >= dist) {
                count++;
                lastPosition = position[i];
                if (count >= m) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```
