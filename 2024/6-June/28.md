# [Maximum Total Importance of Roads](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-28)

## Problem Description
You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Degree Calculation**:
   - Calculate the degree (number of connections) for each city based on the roads array.

2. **Sort Degrees**:
   - Sort the degrees in ascending order.

3. **Calculate Importance**:
   - For each city's degree, calculate its importance as the product of its position (1-based index) and its degree, then accumulate this to get the total importance.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), due to sorting of the degree array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the degree array.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public long maximumImportance(int n, int[][] roads) {
        long[] degree = new long[n];

        for (int[] edge : roads) {
            degree[edge[0]]++;
            degree[edge[1]]++;
        }

        Arrays.sort(degree);

        long value = 1;
        long totalImportance = 0;
        for (long d : degree) {
            totalImportance += (value * d);
            value++;
        }

        return totalImportance;
    }
}
```

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum total importance of all roads by leveraging the degree of each city and sorting them to prioritize roads with higher connections, thus maximizing the total importance.
