# [Grumpy Bookstore Owner](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-21)

## Problem Explanation
In this problem, we need to maximize the number of satisfied customers in a bookstore where the owner can use a secret technique to not be grumpy for `X` consecutive minutes. The satisfaction of customers depends on whether the owner is grumpy or not during each minute.

## Approach
To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Initial Calculation**:
   - Calculate `base`: Total satisfied customers when the owner is not grumpy (`g[i] == 0`).
   - Calculate `add`: Total customers that could be satisfied if the owner uses the technique during grumpy minutes (`g[i] == 1`).
   - Initialize `maxAdd` to track the maximum additional satisfied customers that can be achieved.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Use a sliding window of size `X` to maintain the sum of customers during grumpy minutes (`add`).
   - Slide the window across the array, adjusting `add` by subtracting the customers leaving the window and adding the customers entering the window.
   - Update `maxAdd` with the maximum value of `add` encountered during the iteration.
3. **Result Calculation**:
   - Return `base + maxAdd`, which gives the maximum number of satisfied customers achievable by utilizing the secret technique optimally.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `customers` array. We iterate through the array once to calculate `base`, `add`, and `maxAdd`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSatisfied(int[] customers, int[] grumpy, int X) {
        int n = customers.length;
        int base = 0, add = 0, maxAdd = 0;
        
        // Calculate initial base and add
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (grumpy[i] == 0) {
                base += customers[i];
            }
            if (grumpy[i] == 1) {
                add += customers[i];
            }
            if (i >= X && grumpy[i - X] == 1) {
                add -= customers[i - X];
            }
            maxAdd = Math.max(maxAdd, add);
        }
        
        return base + maxAdd;
    }
}
```

This solution efficiently computes the maximum number of satisfied customers by leveraging a sliding window technique to manage the grumpy intervals and maximize the benefit of the secret technique.
