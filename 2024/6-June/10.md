## Intuition
To determine how many students are not in the correct position according to their height, we can compare the current order with the expected order (sorted order).

## Approach
1. Clone the `heights` array to `expected` and sort `expected`.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to store the number of mismatches.
3. Iterate through the `heights` array.
4. For each index `i`, compare `heights[i]` with `expected[i]`. If they are not equal, increment `count`.
5. Return `count` as the final result.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting the array.
- Space complexity: O(n) for storing the sorted array.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int[] expected = heights.clone();
        Arrays.sort(expected);
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            if (heights[i] != expected[i])
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
