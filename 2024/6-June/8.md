# [Continuous Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-08)

## Approach
1. Create a HashMap to store the remainder of the sum of elements seen so far and the index where that remainder was first encountered.
2. Initialize the HashMap with (0, -1) to handle the case where the subarray starts from index 0.
3. Iterate through the array and calculate the running sum.
4. For each sum, calculate the remainder when divided by k.
5. If the remainder was seen before, check if the current index minus the index stored in the HashMap is greater than 1 (to ensure a subarray of length at least 2).
6. If the condition in step 5 is met, return true.
7. If the remainder is not seen before, store it in the HashMap with its index.
8. If no subarray is found, return false.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array nums. We iterate through the array once.
- Space complexity: O(min(n, k)), where n is the length of the array and k is the value of k. In the worst case, the HashMap can contain min(n, k) entries.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> remainderIndexMap = new HashMap<>();
        remainderIndexMap.put(0, -1); // To handle the case where the subarray starts from index 0
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            int remainder = sum % k;

            if (remainderIndexMap.containsKey(remainder)) {
                if (i - remainderIndexMap.get(remainder) > 1) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                remainderIndexMap.put(remainder, i);
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
