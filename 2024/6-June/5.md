# [Find Common Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-05)

## Approach
1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the common characters.
2. Iterate through each character from 'a' to 'z'.
   - For each character, find the minimum count of its occurrences in all words.
   - Add the character to the `result` list the required number of times.
3. Return the `result` list.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of each word. We iterate through all characters in all words.
- Space complexity: O(1). The output list is not considered as extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> commonChars(String[] words) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Loop through each character from 'a' to 'z'
        for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
            int minCount = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            
            // Count occurrences of the current character in each word
            for (String word : words) {
                int count = 0;
                for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                    if (c == ch) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                minCount = Math.min(minCount, count);
            }
            
            // Add the character to the result list the required number of times
            for (int i = 0; i < minCount; i++) {
                result.add(""+ch);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
