## Intuition
To find the number of subarrays with a sum divisible by `k`, we can use a hashmap to keep track of the cumulative sum remainders when divided by `k`. This helps in identifying subarrays whose sums are divisible by `k`.

## Approach
1. Initialize `ans` to 0 to store the number of valid subarrays.
2. Initialize `sum` to 0 to store the cumulative sum.
3. Use a hashmap `map` to store the frequency of each remainder when the cumulative sum is divided by `k`.
4. Start by putting the remainder 0 with a frequency of 1 in the hashmap.
5. Iterate through each number in `nums`.
   - Add the number to `sum`.
   - Calculate the remainder of `sum` when divided by `k`.
   - If the remainder is negative, adjust it to be within the range [0, k-1].
   - If the remainder exists in the hashmap, increment `ans` by the frequency of that remainder.
   - Update the frequency of the remainder in the hashmap.
6. Return `ans` as the final result.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`.
- Space complexity: O(k), for storing the remainders in the hashmap.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int subarraysDivByK(int[] nums, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(0, 1);

        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            int remainder = sum % k;
            if (remainder < 0) remainder += k;

            if (map.containsKey(remainder)) {
                ans += map.get(remainder);
            }

            map.put(remainder, map.getOrDefault(remainder, 0) + 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
