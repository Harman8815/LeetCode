# [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-02)

## Intuition
To reverse a string in-place, we can use two pointers approach. We swap the characters at the start and end pointers, then move the start pointer forward and the end pointer backward until they meet in the middle.

## Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `start` at index 0 and `end` at index `s.length - 1`.
2. While `start` is less than `end`, swap `s[start]` and `s[end]`, then increment `start` and decrement `end`.
3. After the loop, the string `s` will be reversed in-place.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. We swap characters in-place.
- Space complexity: O(1), using only a fixed amount of additional space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int start = 0, end = s.length - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            char temp = s[start];
            s[start] = s[end];
            s[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
