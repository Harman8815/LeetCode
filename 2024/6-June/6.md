## Approach
1. Check if it's possible to form groups of size `groupSize` from the given hand. If not, return false.
2. Use a TreeMap to count the frequency of each card value.
3. Iterate over the TreeMap:
   - Get the first (lowest) key, which represents the current card.
   - Check if consecutive cards of size `groupSize` starting from the current card are present in the map.
   - If all consecutive cards are present, decrement their counts in the map. If a card's count becomes zero, remove it from the map.
   - If any consecutive card is missing, return false.
4. If the iteration completes without returning false, return true.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of cards in the hand. The TreeMap operations and iteration over the map take O(log n) time, and we do this for each card.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the TreeMap to store the frequencies of cards.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isNStraightHand(int[] hand, int groupSize) {
        if (hand.length % groupSize != 0)
            return false;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int i : hand)
            map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        while (map.size() > 0) {
            int current_card = map.entrySet().iterator().next().getKey();

            for (int i = 0; i < groupSize; i++) {
                if (!map.containsKey(current_card + i))
                    return false;
                map.put(current_card + i,map.get(current_card + i) - 1);
                if (map.get(current_card + i) == 0)
                    map.remove(current_card + i);
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
