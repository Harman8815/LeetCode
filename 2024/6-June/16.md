# [Patching Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-16)

## Intuition
The goal is to ensure that any number in the range [1, n] can be formed using the elements in the array. By keeping track of the smallest number that cannot be formed (`miss`), we can decide when to patch the array with a new number.

## Approach
1. Initialize `miss` to 1, representing the smallest number that cannot be formed.
2. Use a variable `result` to count the number of patches added.
3. Iterate through the array with an index `i`:
   - If `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `miss`, it means the current number can help form up to `miss + nums[i]`. Update `miss` and increment `i`.
   - If `nums[i]` is greater than `miss`, add `miss` to the array (the patch) and double `miss`. Increment the `result`.
4. Continue this process until `miss` exceeds `n`.
5. Return the `result` as the minimum number of patches required.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m), where m is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n) {
        long miss = 1;
        int result = 0;
        int i = 0;

        while (miss <= n) {
            if (i < nums.length && nums[i] <= miss) {
                miss += nums[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                miss += miss;
                result++;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
