# Problem: [Find if Array Can Be Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-array-can-be-sorted/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-11-06)

### Problem Description:
You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers `nums`.

In one operation, you can **swap any two adjacent elements** if they have the **same number of set bits** (the number of `1`s in their binary representation).

You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times, including zero. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to sort the array by repeatedly applying this operation.

### Example 1:

**Input**: `nums = [8, 4, 2, 30, 15]`

**Output**: `true`

**Explanation**:
- The binary representations of the numbers are:
  - `8` → "1000" (1 set bit)
  - `4` → "100" (1 set bit)
  - `2` → "10" (1 set bit)
  - `30` → "11110" (4 set bits)
  - `15` → "1111" (4 set bits)

- We can swap the elements with the same number of set bits:
  1. Swap `8` and `4` → `[4, 8, 2, 30, 15]`
  2. Swap `8` and `2` → `[4, 2, 8, 30, 15]`
  3. Swap `4` and `2` → `[2, 4, 8, 30, 15]`
  4. Swap `30` and `15` → `[2, 4, 8, 15, 30]`
  
- The array is now sorted, so we return `true`.

### Example 2:

**Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

**Output**: `true`

**Explanation**:
- The array is already sorted, so no swaps are needed. The output is `true`.

### Example 3:

**Input**: `nums = [3, 16, 8, 4, 2]`

**Output**: `false`

**Explanation**:
- It is not possible to sort the array using the allowed operations, hence the output is `false`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 28` (i.e., each number is at most `28`)

---

### Approach:

To determine if the array can be sorted using the described swap operation, we need to focus on the condition that two elements can only be swapped if they have the same number of set bits (i.e., the same number of `1`s in their binary representation). 

**Key Idea**:
- Group the numbers by their **number of set bits**. If two elements have the same number of set bits, they can be swapped.
- For each group, check if the elements can be sorted independently. The overall array can be sorted if, within each group, the elements are already in non-decreasing order when sorted by value.

### Steps:
1. **Group by set bits**: First, group the numbers by their number of set bits.
2. **Sort the groups independently**: For each group of numbers that have the same number of set bits, check if sorting them would allow the array to become sorted when considering the entire array.
3. **Return result**: If sorting all the groups independently results in a sorted array, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code Implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public static boolean canSortArray(final int[] nums) {
        short pmax = 0, cmin = 0, cmax = 0;
        byte pcnt = 0;

        // Loop through the array and process each number
        for (final int v : nums) {
            final byte ccnt = (byte) Integer.bitCount(v);  // Get the number of set bits of v
            if (pcnt == ccnt) {
                // If the current number has the same number of set bits as the previous one, 
                // update the min and max for this group
                cmin = cmin > v ? (short) v : cmin;
                cmax = cmax < v ? (short) v : cmax;
            } else if (cmin < pmax) {
                // If the minimum value in the current group is less than the maximum of the previous group,
                // it means we cannot sort the array with the allowed swaps
                return false;
            } else {
                // Update the previous max and set the new group with the current value
                pmax = cmax;
                cmin = cmax = (short) v;
                pcnt = ccnt;
            }
        }

        // Final check: Ensure that the last group's minimum is greater than or equal to the previous max
        return cmin >= pmax;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Tracking set bits**:
   - `Integer.bitCount(v)` returns the number of set bits in the binary representation of `v`.
   - We track the previous set bit count (`pcnt`), the minimum (`cmin`), and the maximum (`cmax`) value in the current group of numbers with the same number of set bits.

2. **Checking for sortable condition**:
   - As we traverse the numbers, if a number has the same number of set bits as the previous number, we update the minimum and maximum values in that group.
   - If the minimum value of the current group is less than the maximum of the previous group, it's impossible to sort the array using the allowed swaps, and we return `false`.

3. **Final check**:
   - After the loop, we check that the minimum of the last group is greater than or equal to the maximum of the previous group.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We iterate through the array once, and the operations inside the loop (like `Integer.bitCount()`) are constant time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, since we are using only a constant amount of extra space (besides the input array).

### Conclusion:
This approach efficiently determines if the array can be sorted by applying the swap operation, with optimal time and space complexity for the problem constraints.
