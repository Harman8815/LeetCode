### Problem: [Minimum Array End](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-array-end/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-11-09)

### Problem Description:
Given two integers `n` and `x`, you are tasked with constructing an array `nums` of size `n` such that:
- For every index `i` in the array (`0 <= i < n - 1`), the elements of the array should be strictly increasing, i.e., `nums[i + 1] > nums[i]`.
- The bitwise AND of all elements of the array `nums` should be equal to `x`.

You need to return the minimum possible value of the last element, `nums[n-1]`.

### Key Insights:
1. **Bitwise AND Requirement**: The bitwise AND of all elements in the array should be equal to `x`. For each element in the array, it must contain the bits of `x` and possibly more, but not fewer.
  
2. **Strictly Increasing Array**: The array should be strictly increasing, so each subsequent element must be greater than the previous one.

3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - Start by initializing the first element of the array to `x`.
   - For each subsequent element, increment the previous element and apply a bitwise OR operation with `x`. This ensures that each element is greater than the last and satisfies the bitwise AND condition when all elements are ANDed together.

### Approach:
1. **Initialize the First Element**: Start with `nums[0] = x`.
2. **Iterate and Build the Array**: For each step from `i = 1` to `n - 1`, update the last element as `(previous_element + 1) | x`. This ensures the array is strictly increasing and maintains the bitwise AND condition.
3. **Return the Last Element**: After constructing the array, return the last element, which will be `nums[n-1]`.

### Code Implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public long minEnd(int n, int x) {
        long result = x;  // Initialize the first element with x.

        // Step 1: Iterate n-1 times (since we already initialized result with x).
        while (--n > 0) {
            // Step 2: Increment result and perform bitwise OR with x to maintain the AND condition.
            result = (result + 1) | x;
        }

        return result;  // Return the last element after n-1 iterations.
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The first element of the array `nums[0]` is initialized to `x`.
2. **Iterate for n-1 times**: For each subsequent element, increment the result and apply the bitwise OR with `x`. This ensures:
   - The array is strictly increasing (`nums[i+1] > nums[i]`).
   - The bitwise AND of all elements remains equal to `x`.
3. **Return the last element**: After constructing the array, return the last element, which is the minimum possible value of `nums[n-1]`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The loop runs `n - 1` times, and each iteration involves a constant-time operation (increment and OR).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: We only need a few variables to store intermediate results (`result` and `n`).

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `n = 3`, `x = 4`

- **First Element**: `nums[0] = 4`
- **Second Element**: `(4 + 1) | 4 = 5 | 4 = 5`
- **Third Element**: `(5 + 1) | 4 = 6 | 4 = 6`

**Output**: `6`

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `n = 2`, `x = 7`

- **First Element**: `nums[0] = 7`
- **Second Element**: `(7 + 1) | 7 = 8 | 7 = 15`

**Output**: `15`

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently constructs the desired array by incrementing the values and maintaining the bitwise AND condition. The time complexity of **O(n)** ensures it can handle large inputs efficiently.
