### Problem: [Circular Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-sentence/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-11-02)

## Problem Description:

A sentence is circular if:
1. The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
2. The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.

For example, sentences like "leetcode exercises sound delightful" and "eetcode" are circular, while sentences like "Leetcode is cool" and "I like Leetcode" are not.

Given a string `sentence`, return `true` if it is a circular sentence, otherwise return `false`.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: sentence = "leetcode exercises sound delightful"
Output: true
Explanation:
- "leetcode" → "exercises" (last character of "leetcode" matches first character of "exercises").
- "exercises" → "sound" (last character of "exercises" matches first character of "sound").
- "sound" → "delightful" (last character of "sound" matches first character of "delightful").
- "delightful" → "leetcode" (last character of "delightful" matches first character of "leetcode").
Thus, the sentence is circular.
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: sentence = "eetcode"
Output: true
Explanation: The sentence contains only one word, and its first and last characters match.
```

**Example 3:**
```plaintext
Input: sentence = "Leetcode is cool"
Output: false
Explanation:
- The last character of "Leetcode" does not match the first character of "is".
Thus, the sentence is not circular.
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= `sentence.length` <= 500
- The sentence consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters and spaces.
- Words in the sentence are separated by a single space, and there are no leading or trailing spaces.

---

### Approach:

1. **Split the Sentence into Words**:
   - We first split the input sentence into words using spaces as delimiters.

2. **Check Pairwise Word Conditions**:
   - For each consecutive pair of words, check if the last character of the current word matches the first character of the next word.

3. **Check the Circular Condition**:
   - Additionally, check if the first character of the first word matches the last character of the last word to ensure the circular condition.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - If all conditions are satisfied, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Code Implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isCircularSentence(String sentence) {
        // Split the sentence into words
        String[] arr = sentence.split(" ");
        
        // Check pairwise word conditions
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            // If the last character of the current word doesn't match the first character of the next word
            if (arr[i].charAt(arr[i].length() - 1) != arr[i + 1].charAt(0)) return false;
        }
        
        // Check the circular condition between the first and the last word
        return arr[0].charAt(0) == arr[arr.length - 1].charAt(arr[arr.length - 1].length() - 1);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Splitting the Sentence**:
   - We use `sentence.split(" ")` to divide the sentence into individual words.

2. **Checking Word Pair Conditions**:
   - For each pair of adjacent words, we check if the last character of the current word (`arr[i].charAt(arr[i].length() - 1)`) matches the first character of the next word (`arr[i + 1].charAt(0)`).
   
3. **Circular Condition**:
   - Finally, we check if the first character of the first word (`arr[0].charAt(0)`) matches the last character of the last word (`arr[arr.length - 1].charAt(arr[arr.length - 1].length() - 1)`).

4. **Return Value**:
   - If all conditions are satisfied, the sentence is circular, and we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the sentence. The splitting of the string takes linear time, and checking each word pair also takes linear time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(k)**, where `k` is the number of words in the sentence (since we store them in an array).

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently checks if a sentence is circular by verifying the character conditions between adjacent words, as well as ensuring that the first and last words match the circularity rule.
