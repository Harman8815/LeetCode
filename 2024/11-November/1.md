### Problem: [Delete Characters to Make Fancy String](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-characters-to-make-fancy-string/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-11-01)

## Problem Description:

You are given a string `s`. Your task is to delete the minimum number of characters to make the string a **fancy string**, which is defined as a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

### Requirements:
- You should return the final string after the deletions.
- The solution must be unique and the number of deletions must be minimized.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "leeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: Remove one 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation: Remove one 'a' from the first group of 'a's and two 'a's from the second group to make "aabaa".
```

**Example 3:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aab"
Explanation: No three consecutive characters are equal, so the string remains unchanged.
```

### Constraints:
- The length of `s` is between `1` and `10^5`.
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Approach:

We need to process the string and ensure that no three consecutive characters are the same. The approach can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Use a StringBuffer for Efficiency**: Since we will be modifying the string, using `StringBuffer` is more efficient than concatenating strings directly, especially for large strings.

2. **Track Consecutive Characters**: We need to keep track of how many consecutive characters we encounter while iterating through the string. If we encounter the same character more than twice in a row, we skip adding it to the result string.

3. **Iterate through the String**:
   - For each character, check if itâ€™s the same as the previous one.
   - If it is, increment a counter.
   - If the counter is less than 3, append the character to the result.
   - If it exceeds 2, skip appending that character.

4. **Edge Cases**: Handle situations where:
   - The string is already a fancy string (no deletions needed).
   - There are only two consecutive characters.

### Code Implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public String makeFancyString(String s) {
        // Use a StringBuffer for efficient string manipulation
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        
        // Variables to track the previous character and the count of consecutive characters
        int length = s.length();
        char prev = ' ';
        int count = 1; // At least one character will always be there

        // Iterate over the string
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            char curr = s.charAt(i);
            
            // Check if the current character is the same as the previous one
            if (curr == prev)
                count++;
            else {
                count = 1; // Reset count when a new character is encountered
                prev = curr; // Update previous character
            }
            
            // Append the character to the result string if count is less than 3
            if (count < 3)
                sb.append(curr);
        }

        // Return the modified string
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **StringBuffer**: We use `StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();` to efficiently build the resulting string.
   
2. **Loop through the String**:
   - We loop through the string character by character. For each character, we check if it's the same as the previous character.
   - If it is the same, we increment the counter (`count`). If it's a different character, we reset the counter and update the `prev` character.
   
3. **Check for Consecutive Characters**: If the counter reaches 3, we don't append the character to the result, ensuring that no more than two consecutive characters are present.

4. **Return the Result**: Once the loop is complete, the `StringBuffer` contains the result string with the minimum deletions.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. We iterate over the string once, and each operation inside the loop takes constant time.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the space used by the `StringBuffer` to store the result string.

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently processes the string to remove characters and make the string fancy by ensuring no three consecutive characters are the same, while minimizing the deletions.
