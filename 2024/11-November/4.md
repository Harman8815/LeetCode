# Problem: [String Compression III](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression-iii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-11-04)

## Problem Description:

Given a string `word`, you need to compress it using the following algorithm:

1. Begin with an empty string `comp`.
2. While `word` is not empty, remove a maximum length prefix of `word` made of a single character `c` repeating at most 9 times.
3. Append the length of this prefix followed by `c` to `comp`.

### Example 1:

**Input**: `"abcde"`

**Output**: `"1a1b1c1d1e"`

**Explanation**: 

- Apply the operation 5 times, choosing "a", "b", "c", "d", and "e" as the prefix in each operation.
- For each prefix, append "1" followed by the character to `comp`.

### Example 2:

**Input**: `"aaaaaaaaaaaaaabb"`

**Output**: `"9a5a2b"`

**Explanation**: 

- Apply the operation 3 times, choosing `"aaaaaaaaa"`, `"aaaaa"`, and `"bb"` as the prefix in each operation.
- For prefix `"aaaaaaaaa"`, append `"9a"` to `comp`.
- For prefix `"aaaaa"`, append `"5a"` to `comp`.
- For prefix `"bb"`, append `"2b"` to `comp`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= word.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.

---

### Approach:

To solve this problem, we will iterate through the string and keep track of consecutive characters. When the current character is different from the previous one (or we have reached the maximum allowed repetition of 9), we append the count and the character to the result. 

### Plan:
1. Use a `StringBuilder` to store the compressed result.
2. Traverse the string:
   - Count how many times the current character repeats consecutively.
   - If the repetition count is less than or equal to 9, append the count and the character to the result.
   - If the repetition count exceeds 9, only append "9" for the count (as the maximum allowed is 9).
3. Return the final compressed string.

### Code Implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public String compressedString(String word) {
        StringBuilder comp = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 1;  // Initialize count for the first character
        
        // Traverse the string starting from the second character
        for (int i = 1; i < word.length(); i++) {
            // Check if the current character is the same as the previous one and the count is less than 9
            if (word.charAt(i) == word.charAt(i - 1) && count < 9) {
                count++;  // Increase the count if the characters are the same and count < 9
            } else {
                // Append the count and character to the result and reset the count
                comp.append(count).append(word.charAt(i - 1));
                count = 1;  // Reset the count for the new character
            }
        }
        
        // Append the last group of characters
        comp.append(count).append(word.charAt(word.length() - 1));
        
        // Return the compressed string
        return comp.toString();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **StringBuilder**: We use `StringBuilder` to efficiently construct the result string `comp`.
2. **Count and Character Handling**: 
   - We keep a `count` variable to track the number of consecutive occurrences of the current character.
   - If the next character is the same and the count is less than 9, we increment the count.
   - When a different character is encountered (or the current sequence exceeds 9 repetitions), we append the `count` and the character to `comp`, and reset `count` to 1 for the next sequence.
3. **Final Append**: After the loop, we append the last sequence of characters to `comp`.
4. **Return**: Finally, we return the string representation of the `StringBuilder`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `word`. We traverse the string once, performing constant-time operations at each step.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, since the `StringBuilder` stores the compressed string, which could be up to the length of the input string in the worst case.

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently compresses the string by iterating through it once, counting consecutive characters, and appending the results to a `StringBuilder`. The time complexity is optimal for this problem's constraints, making it a scalable solution.
