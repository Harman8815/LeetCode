# Problem: [Minimum Number of Changes to Make Binary String Beautiful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-changes-to-make-binary-string-beautiful/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-11-05)

### Problem Description:
You are given a 0-indexed binary string `s` of even length. A string is called **beautiful** if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

1. Each substring has an even length.
2. Each substring contains only `1`s or only `0`s.

You can change any character in `s` to `0` or `1`. The goal is to return the **minimum number of changes** required to make the string beautiful.

### Example 1:

**Input**: `"1001"`

**Output**: `2`

**Explanation**:
- We can change `s[1]` to `1` and `s[3]` to `0`, resulting in `"1100"`.
- The string `"1100"` is beautiful because it can be partitioned into `"11|00"`.
- The minimum number of changes needed is 2.

### Example 2:

**Input**: `"10"`

**Output**: `1`

**Explanation**:
- We change `s[1]` to `1` to get `"11"`.
- The string `"11"` is beautiful because it can be partitioned into `"11"`.
- The minimum number of changes needed is 1.

### Example 3:

**Input**: `"0000"`

**Output**: `0`

**Explanation**:
- The string `"0000"` is already beautiful because it can be partitioned into `"00|00"`.
- No changes are needed.

### Constraints:
- `2 <= s.length <= 10^5` (even length)
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

---

### Approach:

To solve this problem, we can leverage the fact that the string's length is even, and the string must be partitioned into substrings of even length containing only `1`s or only `0`s. We need to minimize the number of changes to make the string beautiful.

- **Key Idea**: We can consider the string in consecutive pairs of characters (`s[i]` and `s[i+1]`). For each pair, the characters should either both be `0`s or both be `1`s. If they are different, we need to change one of the characters to match the other.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Iterate through the string in steps of 2 (i.e., check each consecutive pair of characters).
  2. If the two characters in the pair are not the same (i.e., `s[i] != s[i+1]`), it means we need to change one of them.
  3. Count the number of such changes and return the result.

### Code Implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minChanges(String s) {
        int minChangesRequired = 0;

        // Iterate through the string in steps of 2 to check each pair of characters
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 2) {
            // If the current pair is not equal, we need one change to make them equal
            if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                minChangesRequired++;
            }
        }

        // Return the total number of changes required
        return minChangesRequired;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Iteration over pairs**: We use a `for` loop with a step size of 2 (`i += 2`) to check each consecutive pair of characters (`s[i]` and `s[i+1]`).
2. **Counting changes**: If the two characters in the pair are different, we increment the `minChangesRequired` counter by 1, indicating that we need to change one of the characters to make them the same.
3. **Returning result**: After iterating through the string, the `minChangesRequired` will contain the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We are iterating through the string in steps of 2, so the time complexity is linear in the size of the string.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, as we are using only a constant amount of extra space (besides the input string).

### Conclusion:
This approach efficiently counts the minimum number of changes required to make the binary string beautiful. The time complexity is optimal for the problem's constraints, and the solution uses minimal extra space.
