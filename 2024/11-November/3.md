### Problem: [Rotate String](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-11-03)

## Problem Description:

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` if and only if `s` can become `goal` after some number of shifts on `s`.

A shift on `s` consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position.

For example:
- If `s = "abcde"`, it will become `"bcdea"` after one shift.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Explanation: After shifting "abcde" twice, we get "cdeab", which matches `goal`.
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
Explanation: No number of shifts on "abcde" will result in "abced".
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= `s.length`, `goal.length` <= 100
- Both `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase English letters.

---

### Approach:

To check if `s` can be rotated to become `goal`, we can take advantage of a string property. If we concatenate `s` with itself, we will have all possible rotations of `s` within that new string. For example, if `s = "abcde"`, then `s + s = "abcdeabcde"` contains all of its rotations: `"abcde"`, `"bcdea"`, `"cdeab"`, `"deabc"`, and `"eabcd"`. 

We can then simply check if `goal` is a substring of `s + s`. If it is, then `s` can be rotated to match `goal`; otherwise, it cannot.

### Code Implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) {
        // If the lengths of s and goal are not equal, it's not possible to rotate to match.
        if (s.length() != goal.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        // Concatenate s with itself and check if goal is a substring.
        s = s + s;
        return s.contains(goal);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Length Check**: 
   - First, we check if the lengths of `s` and `goal` are the same. If not, it's impossible for `s` to become `goal` after any number of shifts, so we return `false`.

2. **Concatenate `s` with itself**:
   - We create a new string by concatenating `s` with itself. This ensures that all possible rotations of `s` are embedded in this new string.

3. **Substring Check**:
   - We check if `goal` is a substring of the concatenated string `s + s`. If it is, we return `true`, indicating that `s` can be rotated to become `goal`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s` (and `goal`, since their lengths are equal). Concatenating `s` with itself takes linear time, and checking if `goal` is a substring also takes linear time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s` (since we create a new string `s + s`).

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently checks if one string can become another through rotations by utilizing string concatenation and substring search, which provides a simple and optimal approach to the problem.
