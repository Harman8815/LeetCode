# [Spiral Matrix III](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-08)

## Problem Description
You start at the cell `(rStart, cStart)` of an `rows x cols` grid facing east. The northwest corner is at the first row and column in the grid, and the southeast corner is at the last row and column.

You will walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. Whenever you move outside the grid's boundary, you continue your walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later). Eventually, you reach all `rows * cols` spaces of the grid.

Return an array of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order you visited them.

### Example
- Input: `rows = 1`, `cols = 4`, `rStart = 0`, `cStart = 0`
- Output: `[[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]`
- Explanation: The traversal starts at the top-left corner and moves right across the single row.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialize Directions**:
   - Use an array `dir` to represent the four possible directions (east, south, west, north) in a clockwise manner.

2. **Traversal Setup**:
   - Start from the initial position `(rStart, cStart)` and initialize the result array `traversed` to store the coordinates.
   - Set the starting direction to east and the number of steps to move in the current direction.

3. **Spiral Traversal**:
   - Move in the current direction for the specified number of steps.
   - After completing the moves in the current direction, change direction clockwise and increase the number of steps for the next two directions.
   - Continue this process until all cells are visited.

4. **Boundary Check**:
   - Ensure that the new position is within the grid boundaries before adding it to the result array.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Each cell is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), for storing the result coordinates.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] spiralMatrixIII(int rows, int cols, int rStart, int cStart) {
        int[][] traversed = new int[rows * cols][2];
        int[][] dir = new int[][] { { 0, 1 }, { 1, 0 }, { 0, -1 }, { -1, 0 } };
        int idx = 0;
        int step = 1;
        int direction = 0;

        traversed[idx++] = new int[] { rStart, cStart };

        while (idx < rows * cols) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < step; j++) {
                    rStart += dir[direction][0];
                    cStart += dir[direction][1];
                    if (rStart >= 0 && rStart < rows && cStart >= 0 && cStart < cols) {
                        traversed[idx++] = new int[] { rStart, cStart };
                    }
                }
                direction = (direction + 1) % 4;
            }
            ++step;
        }

        return traversed;
    }
}
