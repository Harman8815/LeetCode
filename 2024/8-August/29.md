# [Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-stones-removed-with-same-row-or-column/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-29947)

## Problem Description
On a 2D plane, we place `n` stones at integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of the `i`-th stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.

### Example
- Input: `stones = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]]`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: We can remove the stones at coordinates `[0, 0]`, `[0, 1]`, `[1, 0]`, and `[1, 1]`. The remaining stone at `[2, 2]` cannot be removed as it does not share the same row or column with any other stone.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Represent the problem as a graph where each stone is a node.
   - Create an adjacency list where each node is connected to other nodes (stones) that share the same row or column.

2. **Build the Graph**:
   - Iterate through all pairs of stones. For each pair, if they share the same row or column, connect them in the graph.

3. **Count Connected Components**:
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to count the number of connected components in the graph. Each connected component corresponds to a group of stones that can be removed together.

4. **Calculate Result**:
   - The maximum number of stones that can be removed is the total number of stones minus the number of connected components. This is because each connected component can have its stones removed except one.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of stones. This is due to the double loop used to build the adjacency list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), due to the adjacency list and additional space for DFS.

## Code
```java
class Solution {

    public int removeStones(int[][] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;

        // Adjacency list to store graph connections
        List<Integer>[] adjacencyList = new List[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adjacencyList[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        // Build the graph: Connect stones that share the same row or column
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (stones[i][0] == stones[j][0] || stones[i][1] == stones[j][1]) {
                    adjacencyList[i].add(j);
                    adjacencyList[j].add(i);
                }
            }
        }

        int numOfConnectedComponents = 0;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];

        // Traverse all stones using DFS to count connected components
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                depthFirstSearch(adjacencyList, visited, i);
                numOfConnectedComponents++;
            }
        }

        // Maximum stones that can be removed is total stones minus number of connected
        // components
        return n - numOfConnectedComponents;
    }

    // DFS to visit all stones in a connected component
    private void depthFirstSearch(
            List<Integer>[] adjacencyList,
            boolean[] visited,
            int stone) {
        visited[stone] = true;

        for (int neighbor : adjacencyList[stone]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                depthFirstSearch(adjacencyList, visited, neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}
