# [Kth Largest Element in a Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-12)

## Problem Description
You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the `k`th highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.

You need to implement a class `KthLargest` which:
- **KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)**: Initializes the object with the integer `k` and the stream of test scores `nums`.
- **int add(int val)**: Adds a new test score `val` to the stream and returns the element representing the `k`th largest element in the pool of test scores so far.

### Example
- Input: `k = 3`, `nums = [4, 5, 8, 2]`
- Output: `obj.add(3) → 4`
- Output: `obj.add(5) → 5`
- Output: `obj.add(10) → 5`
- Output: `obj.add(9) → 8`
- Output: `obj.add(4) → 8`
- Explanation:
  - After adding `3`, the sorted list is `[3, 4, 5, 8]`. The `3rd` largest element is `4`.
  - After adding `5`, the sorted list is `[4, 5, 5, 8]`. The `3rd` largest element is `5`.
  - After adding `10`, the sorted list is `[5, 8, 10]`. The `3rd` largest element is `5`.
  - After adding `9`, the sorted list is `[8, 9, 10]`. The `3rd` largest element is `8`.
  - After adding `4`, the sorted list is `[8, 9, 10]`. The `3rd` largest element is `8`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the `k` largest elements. Initialize it with the first `k` elements from `nums`.

2. **Processing New Scores**:
   - For each new score, add it to the heap.
   - If the heap exceeds size `k`, remove the smallest element (heap's root) to ensure the heap only contains the `k` largest elements.

3. **Return the k-th Largest Element**:
   - The root of the heap (minimum element) will be the `k`th largest element in the stream of scores.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log k) per `add` operation due to heap operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) for storing the heap.

## Code
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class KthLargest {
    private int k;
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> pq;
    
    public KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) {
        this.k = k;
        pq = new PriorityQueue<>(k);
        for (int num : nums) {
            pq.offer(num);
            if (pq.size() > k) pq.poll(); 
        }
    }
    
    public int add(int val) {
        pq.offer(val); 
        if (pq.size() > k) pq.poll();
        return pq.peek();
    }
}

/**
 * Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * KthLargest obj = new KthLargest(k, nums);
 * int param_1 = obj.add(val);
 */
