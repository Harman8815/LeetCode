# [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-271)

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

### Example
- Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`
- Output: `[0, 1]`
- Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1]` is `9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Brute Force**:
   - Use two nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of indices.
   - Check if the sum of the two numbers at these indices equals the target.
   - If a match is found, return the indices of the two numbers.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. This is due to the nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is used.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[] { i, j };
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
