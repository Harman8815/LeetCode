# [Kth Distinct String in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-distinct-string-in-an-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-05)

## Problem Description
A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.

Given an array of strings `arr`, and an integer `k`, return the `k`th distinct string present in `arr`. If there are fewer than `k` distinct strings, return an empty string `""`.

Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.

### Example
- Input: `arr = ["d", "b", "c", "b", "c", "a"]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `"a"`
- Explanation: The distinct strings in the order of appearance are `"d"` and `"a"`. The 2nd distinct string is `"a"`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Count Occurrences**:
   - Use a `HashMap` to count the occurrences of each string in the array.

2. **Identify Distinct Strings**:
   - Iterate through the array and check the count of each string in the `HashMap`. Track the number of distinct strings found.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the `k`th distinct string if it exists, otherwise return an empty string.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is due to iterating through the array twice (once for counting and once for finding the `k`th distinct string).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the counts in the `HashMap`.

## Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public String kthDistinct(String[] arr, int k) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (String str : arr)
            map.put(str, map.getOrDefault(str, 0) + 1);
        
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (map.get(arr[i]) == 1)
                c++;
            if (c == k)
                return arr[i];

        }
        return "";
    }
}
