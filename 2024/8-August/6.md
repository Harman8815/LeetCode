# [Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-pushes-to-type-word-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-06)

## Problem Description
You are given a string `word` containing lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters. For example, the key 2 is mapped with ["a", "b", "c"], so we need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and three times to type "c".

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string `word`.

Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type `word` after remapping the keys.

### Example
- Input: `word = "abc"`
- Output: `6`
- Explanation: With the optimal remapping, the minimum number of pushes required is 6 (1 push for 'a', 2 pushes for 'b', and 3 pushes for 'c').

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - Use a `HashMap` to count the frequency of each character in the `word`.

2. **Max-Heap for Priority**:
   - Use a `PriorityQueue` (max-heap) to prioritize characters based on their frequencies. Characters with higher frequencies should be given priority in the remapping process.

3. **Calculate Minimum Pushes**:
   - For each character, calculate the number of pushes needed based on its position in the heap:
     - Characters assigned to the first 8 keys require 1 push.
     - Characters assigned to the next 8 keys require 2 pushes.
     - Characters assigned to the next 8 keys require 3 pushes.
     - Characters assigned to the last 8 keys require 4 pushes.

4. **Sum the Pushes**:
   - Sum up the total number of pushes required based on the frequency and the number of pushes per key.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k), where n is the length of the string and k is the number of unique characters. This is due to the operations with the priority queue.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), for storing the character frequencies and the priority queue.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minimumPushes(String word) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++){
            char c = word.charAt(i);
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        PriorityQueue<Map.Entry<Character, Integer>> maxHeap =
                new PriorityQueue<>((entry1, entry2) -> entry2.getValue().compareTo(entry1.getValue()));

        maxHeap.addAll(map.entrySet());
        int count = 0;
        for(int j = 1; j <= map.size(); j++){
            Map.Entry<Character, Integer> entry = maxHeap.poll();
            if (j <= 8) {
                count += entry.getValue();
            } else if (j > 8 && j <= 16) {
                count += entry.getValue() * 2;
            } else if (j > 16 && j <= 24) {
                count += entry.getValue() * 3;
            } else {
                count += entry.getValue() * 4;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
