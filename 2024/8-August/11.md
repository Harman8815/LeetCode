# [Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-disconnect-island/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-11)

## Problem Description
You are given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An island is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`s.

The grid is said to be connected if we have exactly one island; otherwise, it is said to be disconnected.

In one day, you are allowed to change any single land cell (`1`) into a water cell (`0`).

Return the minimum number of days required to disconnect the grid.

### Example
- Input: `grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]`
- Output: `1`
- Explanation: Removing any one cell will disconnect the grid.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Check Initial Connectivity**:
   - Use a helper function to count the number of islands in the grid. If the grid is already disconnected (i.e., has more than one island), return `0`.

2. **Try Removing Each Land Cell**:
   - Iterate over each cell in the grid. For each land cell, temporarily change it to water and check the number of islands.
   - If removing this land cell results in more than one island, then we need only one day to disconnect the grid.

3. **Return Minimum Days**:
   - If no single removal can disconnect the grid, it means we need at least two removals. Return `2` as a result.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n * (m * n)), where `m` and `n` are the grid dimensions. This is because for each cell, we may need to check the entire grid to count the islands.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), for the space required by the `seen` matrix used in the DFS.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDays(int[][] grid) {
        if (countIslands(grid) != 1) return 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    grid[i][j] = 0;
                    if (countIslands(grid) != 1) return 1;
                    grid[i][j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return 2;
    }

    private int countIslands(int[][] grid) {
        boolean[][] seen = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        int islands = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && !seen[i][j]) {
                    islands++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j, seen);
                }
            }
        }
        return islands;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] grid, int r, int c, boolean[][] seen) {
        seen[r][c] = true;
        int[][] directions = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < grid.length && nc >= 0 && nc < grid[0].length && grid[nr][nc] == 1 && !seen[nr][nc]) {
                dfs(grid, nr, nc, seen);
            }
        }
    }
}
