# [Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-22476)

## Problem Description
The complement of an integer is the integer obtained by flipping all the bits in its binary representation:
- Change all `0`s to `1`s.
- Change all `1`s to `0`s.

For example:
- The integer `5` is `101` in binary. Its complement is `010`, which is `2`.

Given an integer `num`, return its complement.

### Example
- Input: `num = 5`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The binary representation of `5` is `101`. Flipping all bits gives `010`, which is `2`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Convert to Binary String**:
   - Convert the integer `num` to its binary string representation using `Integer.toBinaryString(num)`.

2. **Compute Complement**:
   - Iterate through each character of the binary string:
     - If the character is `'0'`, append `'1'` to a new string.
     - If the character is `'1'`, append `'0'` to the new string.
   - Convert the resulting binary string (complement) back to an integer using `Integer.parseInt(st.toString(), 2)`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(k), where `k` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `num`. This is because the conversion and iteration processes are proportional to the number of bits.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), due to the space required to store the binary string and its complement.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        String str = Integer.toBinaryString(num);
        StringBuilder st = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '0') st.append('1');
            else st.append('0');
        }
        return Integer.parseInt(st.toString(), 2);
    }
}
