# [Ugly Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-18)

## Problem Description
An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. Given an integer `n`, return the `n`th ugly number.

### Example
- Input: `n = 10`
- Output: `12`
- Explanation: The first 10 ugly numbers are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12], and the 10th is 12.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Use a `PriorityQueue` to keep track of the smallest ugly numbers.
   - Use a `HashSet` to avoid processing the same ugly number multiple times.

2. **Start with the First Ugly Number**:
   - Add the initial ugly number `1` to the priority queue and the set.

3. **Generate Ugly Numbers**:
   - For `n` times, extract the smallest number from the priority queue.
   - Generate new ugly numbers by multiplying the current number by each of the prime factors (2, 3, and 5).
   - Add the new numbers to the priority queue if they haven't been processed before.

4. **Return the nth Ugly Number**:
   - After extracting the nth smallest number from the queue, return it.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * log n), where `n` is the number of ugly numbers to find. Each insertion and extraction from the priority queue takes O(log n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we need to store the ugly numbers in the priority queue and hash set.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        int[] primes = {2, 3, 5};
        PriorityQueue<Long> uglyHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        HashSet<Long> visited = new HashSet<>();
        
        uglyHeap.add(1L);
        visited.add(1L);
        
        long curr = 1L;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            curr = uglyHeap.poll();
            for (int prime : primes) {
                long newUgly = curr * prime;
                if (!visited.contains(newUgly)) {
                    uglyHeap.add(newUgly);
                    visited.add(newUgly);
                }
            }
        }
        return (int)curr;
    }
}
