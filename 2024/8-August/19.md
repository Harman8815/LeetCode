# [2 Keys Keyboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/2-keys-keyboard/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-19)

## Problem Description
You start with a single character 'A' on a notepad. You can perform one of the following two operations:
1. **Copy All**: Copy all the characters currently on the screen.
2. **Paste**: Paste the copied characters from the previous Copy All operation.

Given an integer `n`, return the minimum number of operations required to get exactly `n` 'A's on the screen.

### Example
- Input: `n = 3`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: Initially, the screen has "A". 
    - Perform Copy All (Copy "A").
    - Perform Paste (screen has "AA").
    - Perform Paste again (screen has "AAA").

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to build up to `n` 'A's on the screen with the minimum number of operations. Each operation either copies all the 'A's on the screen or pastes the last copied sequence.

2. **Prime Factorization**:
   - The key observation is that each number `n` can be expressed as a product of its prime factors. To reach exactly `n` 'A's, the optimal number of operations can be derived from these factors.
   - For example, to get `n` 'A's, if `n` can be broken down into `a * b` where `a` and `b` are factors, it means you can reach `n` 'A's by first getting `a` 'A's and then using `b` paste operations (or vice versa).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Start from the smallest factor (2) and divide `n` by this factor as long as it is divisible.
   - Accumulate the factor value into the `steps` count.
   - Continue with the next factor until `n` is reduced to 1.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(sqrt(n)), as the algorithm iterates through possible factors up to the square root of `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        
        int steps = 0;
        int factor = 2;
        
        while (n > 1) {
            while (n % factor == 0) {
                steps += factor;
                n /= factor;
            }
            factor++;
        }
        
        return steps;
    }
}
