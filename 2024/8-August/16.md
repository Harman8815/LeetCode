# [Maximum Distance in Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-distance-in-arrays/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-16)

## Problem Description
You are given `m` arrays, where each array is sorted in ascending order.

You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. We define the distance between two integers `a` and `b` to be their absolute difference `|a - b|`.

Return the maximum distance.

### Example
- Input: `arrays = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`
- Output: `8`
- Explanation: The maximum distance is `|1 - 9| = 8`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `min` to track the minimum value across arrays.
   - `max` to track the maximum value across arrays.
   - `maxDiff` to track the maximum distance found.

2. **Iterate Through Arrays**:
   - For each array, calculate its minimum and maximum values.
   - Update `maxDiff` by calculating the distance between the current array's maximum value and the overall minimum value, and between the current array's minimum value and the overall maximum value.
   - Update `min` and `max` to reflect the minimum and maximum values seen so far.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the `maxDiff` which contains the maximum distance found.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of arrays and `n` is the number of elements in each array. Each element is accessed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a few variables are used to keep track of the minimum and maximum values.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(List<List<Integer>> arrays) {
        if (arrays == null || arrays.isEmpty()) 
            return 0;
        
        int min = arrays.get(0).get(0);
        int max = arrays.get(0).get(arrays.get(0).size() - 1);
        int maxDiff = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < arrays.size(); i++) {
            List<Integer> list = arrays.get(i);
            int currentMin = list.get(0);
            int currentMax = list.get(list.size() - 1);

            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, Math.abs(currentMax - min));
            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, Math.abs(max - currentMin));

            min = Math.min(min, currentMin);
            max = Math.max(max, currentMax);
        }

        return maxDiff;
    }
}
