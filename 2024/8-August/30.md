# [Modify Graph Edge Weights](https://leetcode.com/problems/modify-graph-edge-weights/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-302699)

## Problem Description
You are given an undirected weighted connected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` with weight `wi`.

Some edges have a weight of `-1` (wi = -1), while others have a positive weight (wi > 0).

Your task is to modify all edges with a weight of `-1` by assigning them positive integer values in the range `[1, 2 * 10^9]` so that the shortest distance between the nodes `source` and `destination` becomes equal to an integer `target`. If there are multiple modifications that make the shortest distance between `source` and `destination` equal to `target`, any of them will be considered correct.

Return an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order if it is possible to make the shortest distance from `source` to `destination` equal to `target`, or an empty array if it's impossible.

### Example
- Input: `n = 3`, `edges = [[0, 1, -1], [1, 2, 1], [0, 2, 1]]`, `source = 0`, `destination = 2`, `target = 3`
- Output: `[[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [0, 2, 1]]`
- Explanation: The modified edge weights make the shortest distance between `0` and `2` equal to `3`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each node will have a list of its neighbors and the corresponding edge indices.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   - Run Dijkstra's algorithm twice:
     - First, to compute the shortest path distances from `source` to all nodes with the current weights.
     - Second, to compute the shortest path distances from `source` to all nodes assuming the edges with weight `-1` can be adjusted.

3. **Update Weights**:
   - Calculate the difference needed to adjust the paths where edge weights are `-1` to meet the target distance. If itâ€™s impossible to adjust the weights to meet the target, return an empty array.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If the target distance is achievable, set all `-1` edges to the computed minimal weight required, which is `1` for initial assignment. Return the modified edges.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(E log V), where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices. This is due to the Dijkstra algorithm running twice with a priority queue.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E), due to storing the graph in adjacency lists and distances.

                int weight = edges[edgeIndex][2];

                if (weight == -1) weight = 1; // Initially consider -1 as 1

                if (run == 1 && edges[edgeIndex][2] == -1) {
                    int newWeight = difference + distances[nextNode][0] - distances[currentNode][1];
