# [Maximum Number of Points with Cost](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-points-with-cost/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-17)

## Problem Description
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `points` (0-indexed). Starting with 0 points, you want to maximize the number of points you can get from the matrix.

To gain points, you must pick one cell in each row. Picking the cell at coordinates `(r, c)` will add `points[r][c]` to your score.

However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows `r` and `r + 1` (where `0 <= r < m - 1`), picking cells at coordinates `(r, c1)` and `(r + 1, c2)` will subtract `abs(c1 - c2)` from your score.

Return the maximum number of points you can achieve.

### Example
- Input: `points = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[3,3,3]]`
- Output: `9`
- Explanation: Pick (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) for a maximum score of 9.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `dp` array to keep track of the maximum points achievable up to each column in the current row.
   - Initialize `dp` with the values from the first row of the `points` matrix.

2. **Processing Each Row**:
   - Use two auxiliary arrays `leftMax` and `rightMax` to maintain the maximum values when moving left-to-right and right-to-left, respectively.
   - For each column `i` in the current row, update `leftMax[i]` to be the maximum of the previous `leftMax[i-1]` and `dp[i] + i`.
   - Similarly, update `rightMax[i]` for the current row.
   - Compute `newDp` values by considering the maximum achievable points from both left and right sides for the current cell and add the points for the current cell.

3. **Compute Result**:
   - After processing all rows, find the maximum value in the final `dp` array to get the result.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as only a few arrays of size `n` are used for calculations.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public long maxPoints(int[][] points) {
        int row = points.length;
        int col = points[0].length;
        long[] dp = new long[col];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < col; i++) {
            dp[i] = points[0][i];
        }
        
        for (int r = 1; r < row; r++) {
            long[] leftMax = new long[col];
            long[] rightMax = new long[col];
            long[] newDp = new long[col];
            
            leftMax[0] = dp[0];
            for (int i = 1; i < col; i++) {
                leftMax[i] = Math.max(leftMax[i-1], dp[i] + i);
            }
            
            rightMax[col-1] = dp[col-1] - (col-1);
            for (int i = col-2; i >= 0; i--) {
                rightMax[i] = Math.max(rightMax[i+1], dp[i] - i);
            }
            
            for (int i = 0; i < col; i++) {
                newDp[i] = Math.max(leftMax[i] - i, rightMax[i] + i) + points[r][i];
            }
            
            dp = newDp;
        }
        
        long result = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        for (long value : dp) {
            result = Math.max(result, value);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
