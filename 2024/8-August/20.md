# [Stone Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-201140)

## Problem Description
Alice and Bob are playing a game with piles of stones. The game is played with the following rules:
- There are `n` piles of stones, where each pile has a positive integer number of stones.
- Alice and Bob take turns to take stones from the piles.
- On each player's turn, that player can take all stones from the first `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2*M`. After that, update `M` to `max(M, X)`. Initially, `M = 1`.
- The game ends when all the stones are taken.

The goal is to determine the maximum number of stones Alice can collect if both players play optimally.

### Example
- Input: `piles = [2, 7, 9, 4, 4]`
- Output: `10`
- Explanation: Alice can take piles [2, 7] initially, Bob will take [9] in response, Alice will then take [4] and finally, Bob will take the remaining [4]. Hence, Alice will end up with 10 stones.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Suffix Sum Array**:
   - Compute a suffix sum array `suffixSum` where `suffixSum[i]` contains the total number of stones from pile `i` to the end. This helps to quickly compute the sum of stones available in any subarray.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Use a DP approach with memoization to store intermediate results. The state is defined by the current index in the piles array and the maximum number of piles `M` that can be taken in the current turn.
   - Use recursion to explore all possible moves:
     - If taking `X` piles is valid (i.e., not exceeding the array bounds), compute the result of the game if this move is chosen.
     - Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations and store results of previously computed states.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If taking all remaining piles is possible (i.e., `currIndex + 2 * maxTillNow >= suffixSum.length`), then return the sum of the remaining piles as there are no more moves to make.

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - For each possible move (taking 1 to `2 * maxTillNow` piles), compute the result of the game and find the minimum of these results. Subtract this minimum from the total stones available to compute the maximum stones Alice can collect.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of piles. This is due to the recursive exploration of all possible moves and memoization.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), due to the memoization table.

## Code
```java
class Solution {

    public int stoneGameII(int[] piles) {
        // Store the suffix sum of all array elements.
        int[] suffixSum = Arrays.copyOf(piles, piles.length);

        for (int i = suffixSum.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            suffixSum[i] += suffixSum[i + 1];
        }
        return maxStones(suffixSum, 1, 0, new int[piles.length][piles.length]);
    }

    private int maxStones(
        int[] suffixSum,
        int maxTillNow,
        int currIndex,
        int[][] memo
    ) {
        // If currIndex + 2*maxTillNow lies outside the array, pick all remaining stones.
        if (currIndex + 2 * maxTillNow >= suffixSum.length) {
            return suffixSum[currIndex];
        }
        if (memo[currIndex][maxTillNow] > 0) return memo[currIndex][maxTillNow];
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        // Find the minimum value res for the next move possible.
        for (int i = 1; i <= 2 * maxTillNow; i++) {
            res = Math.min(
                res,
                maxStones(
                    suffixSum,
                    Math.max(i, maxTillNow),
                    currIndex + i,
                    memo
                )
            );
        }
        // Memoize the difference of suffixSum[p] and res. This denotes the maximum
        // stones that can be picked.
        memo[currIndex][maxTillNow] = suffixSum[currIndex] - res;
        return memo[currIndex][maxTillNow];
    }
}
