# [Lemonade Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-15)

## Problem Description
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array `bills` where `bills[i]` is the bill the ith customer pays, return `true` if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or `false` otherwise.

### Example
- Input: `bills = [5, 5, 5, 10, 20]`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation:
  - The first three customers pay with $5 bills, so no change is needed.
  - The fourth customer pays with a $10 bill, and you give $5 change.
  - The fifth customer pays with a $20 bill, and you give $15 change (two $5 bills and one $10 bill).

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Track Change**:
   - Maintain counts of $5 and $10 bills as these are needed to provide change.

2. **Process Each Bill**:
   - If the customer pays with a $5 bill, increment the count of $5 bills.
   - If the customer pays with a $10 bill, check if a $5 bill is available for change. If so, decrement the count of $5 bills and increment the count of $10 bills.
   - If the customer pays with a $20 bill, attempt to provide $15 in change. Prefer giving a $10 bill and a $5 bill (if available), otherwise, try to give three $5 bills.

3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - If at any point you cannot provide the correct change, return `false`.
   - If all customers are served correctly, return `true`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of customers. Each bill is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as only a few variables are used to track the counts of bills.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        int fiveCount = 0;
        int tenCount = 0;

        for (int bill : bills) {
            if (bill == 5) {
                fiveCount++;
            } else if (bill == 10) {
                if (fiveCount > 0) {
                    fiveCount--;
                    tenCount++;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            } else if (bill == 20) {
                if (tenCount > 0 && fiveCount > 0) {
                    tenCount--;
                    fiveCount--;
                } else if (fiveCount >= 3) {
                    fiveCount -= 3;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
