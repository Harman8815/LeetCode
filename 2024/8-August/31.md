# [Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-311514)

## Problem Description
You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is an undirected edge connecting the nodes `a` and `b` with a probability of success of traversing that edge `succProb[i]`.

Given two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from `start` to `end` and return its success probability.

If there is no path from `start` to `end`, return `0`. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most `1e-5`.

### Example
- Input: `n = 3`, `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 2]]`, `succProb = [0.5, 0.5, 0.2]`, `start_node = 0`, `end_node = 2`
- Output: `0.25`
- Explanation: The maximum probability path from node 0 to node 2 is via node 1 with a probability of `0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialize Probabilities**:
   - Create an array `maxProb` to store the maximum probability of reaching each node from the `start_node`. Initialize `maxProb[start_node]` to `1.0` as the starting node has a probability of `1` to reach itself.

2. **Relax Edges**:
   - Use a modified Bellman-Ford approach to relax the edges. Iterate through the edges `n-1` times, and for each edge `(u, v)` with probability `prob`, update the probabilities for nodes `u` and `v`.

3. **Update Probabilities**:
   - For each edge `(u, v)`, update `maxProb[v]` if a better probability is found using `maxProb[u] * prob` and vice versa for `maxProb[u]`.

4. **Check for Early Termination**:
   - If no updates are made in a complete pass, terminate early as further passes will not improve the probabilities.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Return the probability of reaching the `end_node` from `start_node`. If it's not updated from the initial value, return `0`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(E * n), where `E` is the number of edges and `n` is the number of nodes. This is due to the Bellman-Ford algorithm running `n-1` times over all edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to storing the probabilities for each node.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public double maxProbability(int n, int[][] edges, double[] succProb, int start_node, int end_node) {
        double[] maxProb = new double[n];
        maxProb[start_node] = 1.0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            boolean updated = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < edges.length; j++) {
                int u = edges[j][0];
                int v = edges[j][1];
                double prob = succProb[j];

                if (maxProb[u] * prob > maxProb[v]) {
                    maxProb[v] = maxProb[u] * prob;
                    updated = true;
                }
                if (maxProb[v] * prob > maxProb[u]) {
                    maxProb[u] = maxProb[v] * prob;
                    updated = true;
                }
            }
            if (!updated) break;
        }

        return maxProb[end_node];
    }
}
