# [Count Sub Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sub-islands/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-281905)

## Problem Description
You are given two `m x n` binary matrices, `grid1` and `grid2`, containing only `0`s (representing water) and `1`s (representing land). An island is a group of `1`s connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.

An island in `grid2` is considered a sub-island if there is an island in `grid1` that contains all the cells that make up this island in `grid2`.

Return the number of islands in `grid2` that are considered sub-islands.

### Example
- Input:
  ```plaintext
  grid1 = [[1,1,0,0,0],
           [1,1,0,0,0],
           [0,0,1,1,0],
           [0,0,0,1,1]]
  
  grid2 = [[1,0,0,0,0],
           [0,1,0,0,0],
           [0,0,1,1,0],
           [0,0,0,0,0]]
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: The islands in `grid2` that are also present in `grid1` are counted, which in this case are three.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Traverse Grid2**:
   - Iterate through each cell in `grid2`. For every `1` encountered, check if it forms a sub-island by using a helper function.

2. **Check Sub-Island**:
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the island in `grid2` starting from the current cell. During the exploration, mark cells as visited by changing their value to `-1` to avoid revisiting.
   - Compare the cells of this island with the corresponding cells in `grid1`. If any cell in the island in `grid2` does not match the cell in `grid1`, it's not a sub-island.

3. **Count Sub-Islands**:
   - Count and return the number of valid sub-islands found.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is visited once during DFS.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), due to the space used for marking cells as visited.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int countSubIslands(int[][] grid1, int[][] grid2) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid2.length; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < grid2[0].length; j++)
                if (grid2[i][j] == 1 && isSubIsland(grid1, grid2, i, j))
                    result++;
        return result;
    }

    private boolean isSubIsland(int[][] grid1, int[][] grid2, int i, int j) {
        boolean result = true;
        if (i >= 0 && i < grid2.length && j >= 0 && j < grid2[0].length && grid2[i][j] == 1) {
            if (grid2[i][j] != grid1[i][j])
                result = false;
            grid2[i][j] = -1; // Mark Visited
            boolean left = isSubIsland(grid1, grid2, i, j - 1);
            boolean right = isSubIsland(grid1, grid2, i, j + 1);
            boolean top = isSubIsland(grid1, grid2, i - 1, j);
            boolean bottom = isSubIsland(grid1, grid2, i + 1, j);
            if (!left || !right || !top || !bottom)
                return false;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
