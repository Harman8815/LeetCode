# [Number of Senior Citizens](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-senior-citizens/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-01)

## Problem Description
You are given a 0-indexed array of strings `details`. Each element of `details` provides information about a given passenger compressed into a string of length 15. The system is such that:

- The first ten characters consist of the phone number of passengers.
- The next character denotes the gender of the person.
- The following two characters are used to indicate the age of the person.
- The last two characters determine the seat allotted to that person.

Return the number of passengers who are strictly more than 60 years old.

### Example
- Input: `details = ["1234567890M651A", "9876543210F620B", "5555555555M621C"]`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The first and third passengers are above 60 years old. 

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Extract Age**:
   - For each string in the `details` array, extract the age by parsing the substring from index 11 to 13.
   
2. **Count Seniors**:
   - Convert the extracted age to an integer and check if it is greater than 60. Increment the count for each senior citizen.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of passengers. Each string is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a few extra variables.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int countSeniors(String[] details) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (String i : details) {
            int age = Integer.parseInt(i.substring(11, 13));
            if (age > 60) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
