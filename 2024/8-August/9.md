# [Magic Squares In Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/magic-squares-in-grid/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-09)

## Problem Description
A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given a `row x col` grid of integers, how many 3 x 3 magic square subgrids are there?

Note: While a magic square can only contain numbers from 1 to 9, the grid may contain numbers up to 15.

### Example
- Input: `grid = [[4, 3, 8, 1, 5, 7], [9, 5, 1, 4, 2, 6], [2, 9, 7, 6, 1, 5], [7, 2, 9, 6, 4, 8], [3, 7, 6, 1, 8, 9]]`
- Output: `1`
- Explanation: There is exactly one 3x3 magic square subgrid in the provided grid.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Iterate Over Grid**:
   - Loop through each possible top-left corner of a 3x3 subgrid within the main grid.

2. **Check for Magic Square**:
   - For each potential 3x3 subgrid, check if it forms a valid magic square:
     - Ensure that all numbers are distinct and between 1 and 9.
     - Check that the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

3. **Validate Magic Square**:
   - Use a helper function to perform the validation:
     - Check the uniqueness and range of the numbers.
     - Compute and compare the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O((m - 2) * (n - 2) * 9), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. The factor of 9 comes from checking each cell in the 3x3 subgrid.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is needed apart from a few variables.

## Code
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public int numMagicSquaresInside(int[][] grid) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length - 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[i].length - 2; j++) {
                if (isMagicSquare(grid, i, j)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private boolean isMagicSquare(int[][] grid, int r, int c) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = r; i < r + 3; i++) {
            for (int j = c; j < c + 3; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] < 1 || grid[i][j] > 9 || !set.add(grid[i][j])) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        int r1 = grid[r][c] + grid[r][c + 1] + grid[r][c + 2];
        int r2 = grid[r + 1][c] + grid[r + 1][c + 1] + grid[r + 1][c + 2];
        int r3 = grid[r + 2][c] + grid[r + 2][c + 1] + grid[r + 2][c + 2];
        int c1 = grid[r][c] + grid[r + 1][c] + grid[r + 2][c];
        int c2 = grid[r][c + 1] + grid[r + 1][c + 1] + grid[r + 2][c + 1];
        int c3 = grid[r][c + 2] + grid[r + 1][c + 2] + grid[r + 2][c + 2];
        int d1 = grid[r][c] + grid[r + 1][c + 1] + grid[r + 2][c + 2];
        int d2 = grid[r][c + 2] + grid[r + 1][c + 1] + grid[r + 2][c];
        
        return r1 == r2 && r2 == r3 && r3 == c1 && c1 == c2 && c2 == c3 && c3 == d1 && d1 == d2;
    }
}
