## [Length of Longest Subarray with at Most K Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-subarray-with-at-most-k-frequency/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-28)

## Question
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. The frequency of an element x is the number of times it occurs in an array. An array is called good if the frequency of each element in this array is less than or equal to k. Return the length of the longest good subarray of nums. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## Approach
1. Initialize a HashMap `mp` to store the frequency of elements.
2. Initialize variables `ans` to 0 and `l` to 0.
3. Iterate over the array `nums` using a sliding window approach with `r` as the right boundary.
   - Update the frequency of `nums[r]` in `mp`.
   - If the frequency of `nums[r]` exceeds `k`, move the left boundary (`l`) to the right until the frequency becomes less than or equal to `k`.
   - Update `ans` with the maximum length of the subarray.
4. Return `ans`.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of HashMap `mp`, where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the entire array once, where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubarrayLength(int[] nums, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> mp = new HashMap<>();
        int l = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < nums.length; r++) {
            mp.put(nums[r], mp.getOrDefault(nums[r], 0) + 1);
            while (mp.get(nums[r]) > k) {
                mp.put(nums[l], mp.get(nums[l]) - 1);
                l++;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, r - l + 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
