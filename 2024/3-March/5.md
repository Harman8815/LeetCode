# [Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-length-of-string-after-deleting-similar-ends/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-05)
# Intuition
To minimize the length of the string after deleting similar ends, we can use a two-pointer approach. We start with two pointers, `l` at the beginning of the string and `r` at the end of the string. We then move `l` and `r` towards each other, deleting similar characters from both ends as long as they are equal. We continue this process until `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, or until the characters at `l` and `r` are different.

# Approach
1. Initialize `l` to 0 and `r` to the last index of the string `s`.
2. Use a while loop to iterate while `l` is less than `r` and the characters at `l` and `r` are equal.
3. Inside the loop, store the character at `l` in a variable `ch`.
4. While the characters at `l` are equal to `ch`, increment `l`.
5. While the characters at `r` are equal to `ch`, decrement `r`.
6. Return the length of the remaining string, `r - l + 1`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string from both ends towards the center, deleting similar characters.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLength(String s) {
        int l = 0, r = s.length() - 1;
        while (l < r && s.charAt(l) == s.charAt(r)) {
            char ch = s.charAt(l);
            while (l <= r && s.charAt(l) == ch)
                l++;
            while (l <= r && s.charAt(r) == ch)
                r--;
        }
        return r - l + 1;
    }
}
```
