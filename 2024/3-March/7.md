# [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-07)
# Intuition
To find the middle node of a linked list, we can use the "two pointers" approach. We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, initially pointing to the head of the linked list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. When the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle node.

# Approach
1. Initialize `slow` and `fast` pointers to the head of the linked list.
2. Use a while loop to iterate as long as `fast` and `fast.next` are not null.
3. Inside the loop, move `slow` one step forward and `fast` two steps forward.
4. When the loop exits, `slow` will be pointing to the middle node.
5. Return the `slow` pointer.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We need to traverse the list once to find the middle node.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 * int val;
 * ListNode next;
 * ListNode() {}
 * ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 * ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
}
```
