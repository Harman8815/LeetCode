# [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-21)
# Intuition
To reverse a linked list, we can iterate through the list and reverse the direction of pointers.

# Approach
1. Initialize three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next`.
2. Iterate through the list:
   - Store the next node of `curr` in `next`.
   - Reverse the direction of `curr`'s pointer to point to `prev`.
   - Move `prev` and `curr` one step forward.
3. Return `prev`, which is now the new head of the reversed list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We iterate through the list once.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode curr = head;
        ListNode prev = null;
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```
