# [Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-zero-sum-consecutive-nodes-from-linked-list/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-12)
# Intuition
To remove consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 from a linked list, we can use a HashMap to store the prefix sum of nodes encountered so far. If we encounter a prefix sum that we have seen before, it means that the sum of nodes between the two prefix sums is 0 and we can remove those nodes.

# Approach
1. Initialize a HashMap `map` to store the prefix sum of nodes encountered so far. Also, create a dummy node and point its next to the head of the linked list.
2. Initialize `prefixSum` to 0.
3. Iterate over the linked list nodes (`head`) while it is not null:
    - Update `prefixSum` by adding the current node's value.
    - If `map` contains `prefixSum`, it means there is a consecutive sequence of nodes whose sum is 0. We need to remove those nodes:
        - Get the starting node of the sequence from `map`.
        - Iterate from the starting node to the current node (excluding the current node):
            - Update `prefixSum` by subtracting each node's value from it.
            - Remove the prefix sum from `map`.
        - Update the next pointer of the starting node to point to the node after the current node.
    - If `map` does not contain `prefixSum`, add `prefixSum` and the current node to `map`.
    - Move `head` to the next node.
4. Return the next node of the dummy node, which is the head of the modified linked list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We iterate through the linked list once.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We use extra space for the HashMap.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode head) {
        int prefixSum = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, ListNode> map = new HashMap<>();
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        map.put(0, dummy);
        while (head != null) {
            prefixSum += head.val;
            if (map.containsKey(prefixSum)) {
                ListNode start = map.get(prefixSum);
                ListNode temp = start;
                int sum = prefixSum;
                while (temp != head) {
                    temp = temp.next;
                    sum += temp.val;
                    if (temp != head)
                        map.remove(sum);
                }
                start.next = head.next;
            } else {
                map.put(prefixSum, head);
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
