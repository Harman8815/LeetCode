# [Minimum Common Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-common-value/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-09)
# Intuition
To find the minimum common value in two sorted arrays, we can use a two-pointer approach. We start with two pointers, `i` for `nums1` and `ii` for `nums2`, both pointing to the beginning of their respective arrays. We then move the pointers towards each other, comparing the values at each pointer. If the value at `nums1[i]` is less than `nums2[ii]`, we increment `i`. If the value at `nums2[ii]` is less than `nums1[i]`, we increment `ii`. If the values are equal, we return that value as the minimum common value.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `ii`, to 0 for `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
2. Use a while loop to iterate as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums1` and `ii` is less than the length of `nums2`.
3. Inside the loop, compare the values at `nums1[i]` and `nums2[ii]`.
4. If `nums1[i]` is less than `nums2[ii]`, increment `i`.
5. If `nums2[ii]` is less than `nums1[i]`, increment `ii`.
6. If the values are equal, return that value as the minimum common value.
7. If the loop exits without finding a common value, return -1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2`. We iterate through both arrays once.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int getCommon(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        for (int i = 0, ii = 0; i < nums1.length && ii < nums2.length;) {
            if (nums1[i] < nums2[ii])
                ++i;
            else if (nums1[i] == nums2[ii])
                return nums1[i];
            else
                ++ii;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
