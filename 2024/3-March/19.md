# [Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-19)
# Intuition
To minimize the total time required to execute the tasks, we should try to execute the tasks with the highest frequency first. We can use a greedy approach to schedule tasks such that we minimize idle time.

# Approach
1. Count the frequency of each task and store it in an array `freq`.
2. Sort the `freq` array in descending order to prioritize tasks with higher frequency.
3. Calculate the maximum number of chunks that can be formed with the most frequent task, which is `chunk = freq[25] - 1`.
4. Calculate the total idle time required, which is `idle = chunk * n`.
5. Iterate over the remaining tasks (from index 24 to 0) and subtract the minimum of `chunk` and the task frequency from the `idle` time.
6. Return the total time required, which is either the sum of the tasks and idle time or just the sum of the tasks if the idle time is negative.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of tasks. We iterate over the tasks twice: once to calculate the frequencies and once to calculate the idle time.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we use a fixed-size array of size 26 for storing task frequencies.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char task : tasks) {
            freq[task - 'A']++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(freq);
        int chunk = freq[25] - 1;
        int idle = chunk * n;

        for (int i = 24; i >= 0; i--) {
            idle -= Math.min(chunk, freq[i]);
        }

        return idle < 0 ? tasks.length : tasks.length + idle;
    }
}
```
