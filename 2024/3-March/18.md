# [Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-18)
# Intuition
To burst all balloons, we need to shoot arrows along the y-axis. We can sort the balloons based on their end positions and then iterate through them, shooting an arrow when the current balloon's start position is greater than the previous balloon's end position.

# Approach
1. Sort the balloons based on their end positions in ascending order.
2. Initialize a variable `arrows` to 1 (assuming at least one arrow is needed) and a variable `prevEnd` to the end position of the first balloon.
3. Iterate through the sorted balloons starting from the second balloon:
   - If the start position of the current balloon is greater than `prevEnd`, increment `arrows` by 1 and update `prevEnd` to the end position of the current balloon.
4. Return `arrows`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of balloons. Sorting the balloons takes O(n log n) time.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        
        int arrows = 1;
        int prevEnd = points[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; ++i) {
            if (points[i][0] > prevEnd) {
                arrows++;
                prevEnd = points[i][1];
            }
        }
        
        return arrows;
    }
}
```
