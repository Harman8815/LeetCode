## [Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

## Question
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

## Approach
1. Sort the array `arr` in non-decreasing order.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and check if the current element is equal to the next element.
3. If it is, return the current element as it is the duplicate number.
4. If no duplicates are found, return -1.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the input array `arr`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == arr[i + 1])
                return arr[i];
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
