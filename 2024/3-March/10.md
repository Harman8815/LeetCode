# [Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-10)
# Intuition
To find the intersection of two arrays, we can use a HashSet to store the unique elements of one array (`nums1`) and then iterate through the other array (`nums2`) to find the common elements.

# Approach
1. Initialize two HashSet objects, `set1` and `set2`.
2. Iterate through `nums1` and add each element to `set1`.
3. Iterate through `nums2` and for each element, if it is present in `set1`, add it to `set2`.
4. Initialize an array `result` of size `set2.size()` to store the intersection elements.
5. Iterate through `set2` and populate the `result` array.
6. Return the `result` array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2`. We iterate through both arrays once to populate the hash sets.
- Space complexity: O(min(n, m)) for the HashSet objects `set1` and `set2`, where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2`. The space used is proportional to the size of the smaller array.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] intersection(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {

        Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<>();
        for (int n1 : nums1) {
            set1.add(n1);
        }
        Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<>();
        for (int n2 : nums2) {

            if (set1.contains(n2)) {
                set2.add(n2);
            }
        }

        int[] result = new int[set2.size()];
        int i = 0;
        for (int x : set2) {
            result[i] = x;
            i++;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
