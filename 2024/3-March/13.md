# Intuition
To find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x equals the sum of all elements between x and n, we can iterate from 1 to n and calculate the sum of elements on the left and right sides of each integer x. If the sums are equal, we have found the pivot integer.

# Approach
1. Iterate from 1 to n, inclusive, and for each integer i:
    - Calculate the sum of all elements from 1 to i and store it in `sumLeft`.
    - Calculate the sum of all elements from i to n and store it in `sumRight`.
    - If `sumLeft` equals `sumRight`, return i as the pivot integer.
2. If no pivot integer is found, return -1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the given positive integer. We iterate from 1 to n and for each i, we calculate the sum of elements on the left and right sides of i.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int pivotInteger(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int sumLeft = 0;
            int sumRight = 0;

            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                sumLeft += j;
            }
            for (int k = i; k <= n; k++) {
                sumRight += k;
            }
            if (sumLeft == sumRight) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1; 
    }
}
```
