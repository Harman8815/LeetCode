# [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-06)
# Intuition
To determine if a linked list has a cycle, we can use the Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, initially pointing to the head of the linked list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer.

# Approach
1. Initialize `slow` and `fast` pointers to the head of the linked list.
2. Use a while loop to iterate as long as `fast` is not null and `fast.next` is not null.
3. Inside the loop, move `slow` one step forward and `fast` two steps forward.
4. If at any point `slow` and `fast` point to the same node, return true (there is a cycle).
5. If the loop exits without finding a cycle, return false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, we need to traverse the entire linked list.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
         ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;

            if (fast == slow) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false; 
    }
}
```
