# [Bag of Tokens](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-04)
# Intuition
To maximize the total score, we can sort the tokens array and then use a two-pointer approach. We start with the lowest token and try to gain score by playing face-up. If we cannot play face-up anymore, we try to play face-down to gain power.

# Approach
1. Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the last index of the sorted `tokens` array.
2. Initialize `score` to 0 and sort the `tokens` array.
3. Use a while loop to iterate until `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
4. If the current `power` is greater than or equal to the value of the token at index `low`, play face-up: increment `score` by 1, decrement `power` by the token value, and move `low` to the right.
5. If `low` is less than `high` and `score` is greater than 0 (meaning we have some score to sacrifice), play face-down: decrement `score` by 1, increment `power` by the value of the token at index `high`, and move `high` to the left.
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, return the current `score`.
7. Return the final `score`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of tokens. This is due to the sorting step.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int bagOfTokensScore(int[] tokens, int power) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = tokens.length - 1;
        int score = 0;
        Arrays.sort(tokens);

        while (low <= high) {
            if (power >= tokens[low]) {
                score += 1;
                power -= tokens[low];
                low += 1;
            } else if (low < high && score > 0) {
                score -= 1;
                power += tokens[high];
                high -= 1;
            } else {
                return score;
            }
        }
        return score;
    }
}
```
