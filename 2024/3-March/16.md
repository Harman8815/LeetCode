# [Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-16)
# Intuition
To find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s, we can use a hashmap to store the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far. We initialize the hashmap with an initial count of 0 at index -1 to handle the case where the entire subarray from index 0 to the current index has an equal number of 0s and 1s.

# Approach
1. Initialize a hashmap `map` with an initial count of 0 at index -1.
2. Initialize variables `maxlen` to store the maximum length and `count` to track the running count of 0s and 1s (incrementing by 1 for 1 and decrementing by 1 for 0).
3. Iterate through the array `nums`:
    - Update `count` based on the current element (`1` increments `count`, `0` decrements `count`).
    - If `map` contains the current count, update `maxlen` to the maximum of `maxlen` and the difference between the current index and the index stored in `map` for the current count (indicating a subarray with equal 0s and 1s).
    - If `map` does not contain the current count, add the current count to `map` with the current index as the value.
4. Return `maxlen`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. We iterate through `nums` once.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the hashmap `map`.

# Code
```java
public class Solution {

    public int findMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(0, -1);
        int maxlen = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            count = count + (nums[i] == 1 ? 1 : -1);
            if (map.containsKey(count)) {
                maxlen = Math.max(maxlen, i - map.get(count));
            } else {
                map.put(count, i);
            }
        }
        return maxlen;
    }
}
```
