# [Merge In Between Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-in-between-linked-lists/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-20)
# Intuition
To merge list2 into list1 between the ath and bth nodes, we need to find the ath-1 and bth nodes of list1 and connect them with list2.

# Approach
1. Find the ath-1 node of list1 and store it in list1_a.
2. Find the bth node of list1 and store it in list1_b.
3. Find the end node of list2 and store it in list2_end.
4. Connect list1_a to list2 and list2_end to list1_b.
5. Return the head of list1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(max(n, m)), where n is the number of nodes in list1 and m is the number of nodes in list2. We iterate over both lists once.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeInBetween(ListNode list1, int a, int b, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode list2_end = list2;
        ListNode list2_start = list2;
        
        while (list2_end.next != null)
            list2_end = list2_end.next;

        ListNode list1_a = null;
        ListNode list1_b = null;

        ListNode header = list1;

        for (int i = 1; i < a; i++)
            header = header.next;
        list1_a = header;

        for (int i = a - 1; i <= b; i++)
            header = header.next;
        list1_b = header;

        list1_a.next = list2_start;
        list2_end.next = list1_b;
        
        return list1;
    }
}
```
