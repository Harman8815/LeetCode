# [Custom Sort String](https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-11)
# Intuition
To custom sort a string `s` according to the order specified in `order`, we can use a HashMap to store the frequency of each character in `s`. Then, we iterate over the characters in `order` and append them to the result string according to their frequency in `s`. Finally, we append any remaining characters from `s` that are not in `order`.

# Approach
1. Initialize a StringBuilder `result` to store the custom-sorted string.
2. Initialize a HashMap `mp` to store the frequency of each character in `s`.
3. Iterate over each character `c` in `s` and update its frequency in `mp`.
4. Iterate over each character `c` in `order`:
    - If `mp` contains `c`, append `c` to `result` `mp[c]` times and remove `c` from `mp`.
5. Append any remaining characters from `mp` to `result`.
6. Return the string representation of `result`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of `order` and m is the length of `s`. We iterate over both strings to populate the HashMap and build the result string.
- Space complexity: O(m), where m is the length of `s`. We use extra space for the HashMap and the StringBuilder.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String customSortString(String order, String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> mp = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            mp.put(c, mp.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        for (char c : order.toCharArray()) {
            if (mp.containsKey(c)) {
                result.append(String.valueOf(c).repeat(Math.max(0, mp.get(c))));
                mp.remove(c);
            }
        }
        for (char c : mp.keySet()) {
            result.append(String.valueOf(c).repeat(Math.max(0, mp.get(c))));
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```
