# [Number of Subarrays with Sum Goal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-14)
# Intuition
To find the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum equal to the goal, we can use a prefix sum approach. We iterate over the array `nums`, maintaining a running sum `currentSum` and a HashMap `freq` to store the frequency of prefix sums. For each element `num` in `nums`:
1. Update `currentSum` by adding `num`.
2. If `currentSum` equals `goal`, increment `totalCount` by 1.
3. Check if there is any prefix sum that can be subtracted from `currentSum` to get the desired goal (`currentSum - goal`). If such a prefix sum exists, add its frequency to `totalCount`.
4. Update the frequency of the current prefix sum in `freq`.
5. Return `totalCount`.

# Approach
1. Initialize `totalCount` to 0, `currentSum` to 0, and a HashMap `freq` to store the frequency of prefix sums.
2. Iterate over each element `num` in `nums`:
    - Update `currentSum` by adding `num`.
    - If `currentSum` equals `goal`, increment `totalCount` by 1.
    - Check if `freq` contains the key `currentSum - goal`. If it does, add its value to `totalCount`.
    - Update the frequency of `currentSum` in `freq`.
3. Return `totalCount`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. We iterate through `nums` once.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the HashMap `freq`, as in the worst case, all prefix sums are distinct.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int numSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {
        int totalCount = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        for (int num : nums) {
            currentSum += num;
            if (currentSum == goal) {
                totalCount++;
            }
            if (freq.containsKey(currentSum - goal)) {
                totalCount += freq.get(currentSum - goal);
            }
            freq.put(currentSum, freq.getOrDefault(currentSum, 0) + 1);
        }

        return totalCount;
    }
}
```
