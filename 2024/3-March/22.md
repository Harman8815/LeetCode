# [Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-22)
## Problem
Given the head of a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

## Intuition
To check if a linked list is a palindrome, we can reverse the second half of the list and compare it with the first half. If they match, the list is a palindrome.

## Approach
1. Find the middle of the list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. Reverse the second half of the list.
3. Compare the reversed second half with the first half.
4. If they match, the list is a palindrome.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We iterate through the list twice: once to find the middle and once to reverse the second half.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        if (fast != null) { // Odd number of nodes
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        slow = reverseList(slow);
        fast = head;
        while (slow != null) {
            if (fast.val != slow.val) {
                return false;
            }
            fast = fast.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        return true;
    }

    private ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```
