### [Sum of All Subset XOR Totals](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-all-subset-xor-totals/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-20)

## Question
The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.

For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.
Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums. 

Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.

An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.

## Approach
1. Use backtracking to generate all subsets of the array.
2. For each subset, calculate the XOR total.
3. Return the sum of all XOR totals.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as there are 2^n subsets to consider.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, due to the recursion stack.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int subsetXORSum(int[] nums) {
        return backtrack(nums, 0, 0);
    }
    
    private int backtrack(int[] nums, int index, int result) {
        if (index == nums.length) 
            return result;
        
        int include = backtrack(nums, index + 1, result ^ nums[index]);
        int exclude = backtrack(nums, index + 1, result);
        return include + exclude;
    }
}
```
