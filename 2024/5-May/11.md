## Intuition and Approach
To hire exactly `k` workers while satisfying the given conditions, we need to minimize the total cost of hiring them. The key observation is to use the ratio of wage to quality to determine the payment structure.

### Intuition
1. **Wage-to-Quality Ratio**:
   - Each worker has a minimum wage expectation and a quality value.
   - The ratio of wage to quality (`wage[i] / quality[i]`) represents the minimum wage per unit of quality the worker demands.

2. **Sorting by Ratio**:
   - By sorting workers based on their wage-to-quality ratio, we can ensure that the group of `k` workers will have the minimum total cost while respecting the proportional payment rule.

3. **Using a Priority Queue**:
   - To always keep track of the highest quality workers and ensure we have exactly `k` workers, we use a max-heap (priority queue).
   - This allows us to efficiently manage the total quality and remove the highest quality worker when needed to maintain the size of the group.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Wage-to-Quality Ratios**:
   - Compute the ratio for each worker and store it along with their quality.

2. **Sort Workers**:
   - Sort the workers based on the computed ratio in ascending order.

3. **Using a Max-Heap**:
   - Use a max-heap to keep track of the top `k` workers by quality.
   - Iterate through the sorted list and add workers to the heap.
   - If the heap exceeds size `k`, remove the highest quality worker.
   - For each valid group of `k` workers, calculate the total cost and update the minimum cost if itâ€™s lower.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the ratios and the max-heap.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n log n) for sorting and O(n log k) for heap operations.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public double mincostToHireWorkers(int[] quality, int[] wage, int k) {
        int n = quality.length;
        double totalCost = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        double currentTotalQuality = 0;
        List<Pair<Double, Integer>> wageToQualityRatio = new ArrayList<>();

        // Calculate wage-to-quality ratio for each worker
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            wageToQualityRatio.add(new Pair<>((double) wage[i] / quality[i], quality[i]));
        }

        // Sort workers based on their wage-to-quality ratio
        Collections.sort(wageToQualityRatio, Comparator.comparingDouble(Pair::getKey));

        // Use a priority queue to keep track of the highest quality workers
        PriorityQueue<Integer> highestQualityWorkers = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

        // Iterate through workers
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            highestQualityWorkers.add(wageToQualityRatio.get(i).getValue());
            currentTotalQuality += wageToQualityRatio.get(i).getValue();

            // If we have more than k workers, remove the one with the highest quality
            if (highestQualityWorkers.size() > k) {
                currentTotalQuality -= highestQualityWorkers.poll();
            }

            // If we have exactly k workers, calculate the total cost and update if it's the minimum
            if (highestQualityWorkers.size() == k) {
                totalCost = Math.min(totalCost, currentTotalQuality * wageToQualityRatio.get(i).getKey());
            }
        }
        return totalCost;
    }
}
```
