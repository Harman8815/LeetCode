## [Delete Leaf Nodes with Target Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-17)

## Question
Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

## Approach
1. Recursively traverse the tree.
2. Delete leaf nodes with the target value.
3. Continue deleting parent nodes if they become leaf nodes after deletion.
4. Return the modified root.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node once.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode removeLeafNodes(TreeNode root, int target) {
        return helper(root, target);
    }

    private TreeNode helper(TreeNode node, int target) {
        if (node == null)
            return null;

        node.left = helper(node.left, target);
        node.right = helper(node.right, target);
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null && node.val == target) {
            return null;
        }
        return node;
    }
}
```
