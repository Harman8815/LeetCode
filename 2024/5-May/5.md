# [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-05)

## Intuition
To delete a node from a singly-linked list, we can copy the value of the next node to the current node and then skip the next node by pointing the current node's next pointer to the next node's next pointer.

## Approach
1. Copy the value of the next node to the current node (`node`).
2. Skip the next node by pointing `node.next` to `node.next.next`.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(1), as we are only modifying the node and its next node.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
