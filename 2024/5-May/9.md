# [Maximize Happiness Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-happiness-of-selected-children/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-09)

## Approach
1. Sort the happiness array in ascending order.
2. Iterate through the sorted array from the end.
3. For each element, calculate the maximum happiness value that can be achieved by selecting it in the current turn.
4. Keep track of the total sum of happiness values and the number of children selected.
5. Stop iterating when the required number of children have been selected.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n log n) for sorting the array.
- Space complexity: O(1).

## Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public long maximumHappinessSum(int[] happiness, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(happiness);
        long ans = 0;
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = happiness.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int max = Math.max(0, happiness[i] - c);
            ans += max;
            c++;
            if (c >= k) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
