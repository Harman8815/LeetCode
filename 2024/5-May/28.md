# [Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-28)

## Intuition
To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window [start, end] where the total cost of transforming substring `s[start:end]` to `t[start:end]` is less than or equal to `maxCost`. We expand the window by moving the `end` pointer and adjust the `start` pointer to keep the total cost within the budget.

## Approach
1. Initialize variables `start`, `currentCost`, and `maxLength` to 0.
2. Iterate through the string with the `end` pointer.
   - Calculate the cost of changing `s[end]` to `t[end]` and add it to `currentCost`.
   - If `currentCost` exceeds `maxCost`, increment the `start` pointer to shrink the window and reduce the `currentCost`.
   - Update `maxLength` with the maximum length of the valid window.
3. Return `maxLength`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input strings `s` and `t`. Each character is processed at most twice (once when `end` pointer advances and possibly once when `start` pointer advances).
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a fixed amount of additional space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
        int n = s.length();
        int start = 0;
        int currentCost = 0;
        int maxLength = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < n; ++end) {
            currentCost += Math.abs(s.charAt(end) - t.charAt(end));

            while (currentCost > maxCost) {
                currentCost -= Math.abs(s.charAt(start) - t.charAt(start));
                ++start;
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
