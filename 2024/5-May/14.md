## [Maximum Gold Collection in a Mine](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-gold/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-14)

## Intuition and Approach
Given a gold mine grid of size `m x n`, where each cell contains an integer representing the amount of gold or 0 if it is empty, the goal is to determine the maximum amount of gold that can be collected under specific conditions. You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold, and you cannot visit the same cell more than once or visit a cell with 0 gold.

### Intuition
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - To explore all possible paths from any starting cell with gold, a DFS approach is suitable. This allows us to collect gold recursively from all four possible directions (left, right, up, down).

2. **Backtracking**:
   - Since we cannot visit the same cell twice, we use a backtracking technique to mark cells as visited during the current path exploration and unmark them afterward for other paths.

3. **Maximize Gold**:
   - During DFS traversal, we keep track of the gold collected and update the maximum gold collected whenever a new maximum is found.

### Approach
1. **Iterate Through Each Cell**:
   - Traverse the entire grid, and for each cell that contains gold, initiate a DFS.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - Implement a DFS function that explores all possible moves (left, right, up, down) from the current cell.
   - Accumulate the gold collected and update the maximum gold.
   - Use a `visited` matrix to track the cells visited in the current path.

3. **Backtracking**:
   - After exploring all possible paths from a cell, backtrack by unmarking the cell as visited to allow other paths to explore it.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(m * n) due to the `visited` matrix used for tracking visited cells.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O((m * n) * 4^k) where `k` is the length of the longest path of gold cells since each cell can potentially initiate a DFS with 4 possible directions.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    private int maxGold = 0;

    public int getMaximumGold(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                    boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
                    dfs(grid, visited, i, j, 0);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxGold;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] grid, boolean[][] visited, int r, int c, int currentGold) {
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= grid.length || c >= grid[0].length || grid[r][c] == 0 || visited[r][c]) {
            return;
        }

        visited[r][c] = true;
        currentGold += grid[r][c];
        maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, currentGold);

        int[][] directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int newRow = r + dir[0];
            int newCol = c + dir[1];
            dfs(grid, visited, newRow, newCol, currentGold);
        }

        visited[r][c] = false;
    }
}
```
