## Intuition
To compare version strings, we split both version strings by "." and compare the corresponding revision values in left-to-right order. If one of the version strings has fewer revisions, we treat the missing revision values as 0.

## Approach
1. Split both version strings `version1` and `version2` by "." and store the resulting arrays in `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.
2. Get the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2` and initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to 0.
3. Initialize a temporary string `temp` to "0" to handle cases where one version string has fewer revisions.
4. Iterate through `arr1` and `arr2` using the pointers `i` and `j` respectively, comparing the revision values at each index.
   - If the revision values are equal, increment both pointers.
   - If one of the revision values is missing (i.e., the pointer exceeds the length of the array), use the temporary string `temp` as the revision value.
   - If the revision values are not equal, return the result of comparing them using `Integer.compare`.
5. If the loop completes without returning, return 0 to indicate that the version strings are equal.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the maximum number of revisions between the two version strings. We iterate through each revision value once.
- Space complexity: O(n), for the arrays `arr1` and `arr2` which can store at most n revision values.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int compareVersion(String version1, String version2) {
        String arr1[] = version1.split("\\.");
        String arr2[] = version2.split("\\.");

        int len1 = arr1.length;
        int len2 = arr2.length;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        String temp = "0";
        String p1, p2;
        while (i < len1 || j < len2) {
            p1 = i < len1 ? arr1[i] : temp;
            p2 = j < len2 ? arr2[j] : temp;
            int cmp = Integer.compare(Integer.parseInt(p1), Integer.parseInt(p2));
            if (cmp != 0) {
                return cmp;
            }
            i++;
            j++;
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
