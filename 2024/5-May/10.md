## [Kth Smallest Prime Fraction](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-10)

## Intuition and Approach
To find the `k`th smallest fraction from an array of unique primes and `1`, we can use binary search on the possible values of the fractions.

### Intuition
1. **Binary Search on Fraction Values**: 
   - The smallest fraction can be as low as `0` and the largest fraction can be `1`. We can use these as our initial bounds.
   - By repeatedly narrowing down this range, we can zero in on the value of the `k`th smallest fraction.

2. **Counting Fractions**:
   - For each midpoint value in our binary search, we need to count how many fractions are smaller than this midpoint.
   - If the count of these smaller fractions equals `k`, we have found our desired fraction.
   - If there are more than `k` fractions, we know our desired fraction lies in the lower half of our range.
   - If there are fewer than `k` fractions, it lies in the upper half.

### Approach
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Initialize `left` to `0` and `right` to `1`.
   - While `left` is less than `right`, compute the midpoint `mid = (left + right) / 2`.

2. **Counting Smaller Fractions**:
   - For each `i`, use a nested loop to count how many fractions `arr[i] / arr[j]` are less than `mid`.
   - Track the largest fraction found that is still less than `mid` to identify the correct fraction.

3. **Adjusting Search Range**:
   - If the total count of fractions less than `mid` is exactly `k`, return this fraction.
   - Otherwise, adjust the search range (`left` or `right`) based on whether we have more or fewer than `k` fractions smaller than `mid`.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a few extra variables for binary search.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n * log(1/ε)), where `n` is the length of the array and `ε` is the precision of the binary search.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] kthSmallestPrimeFraction(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        double left = 0, right = 1.0;
        
        // Binary search for finding the kth smallest prime fraction
        while (left < right) {
            // Calculate the middle value
            double mid = (left + right) / 2;
            
            // Initialize variables to keep track of maximum fraction and indices
            double maxFraction = 0.0;
            int totalSmallerFractions = 0, numeratorIdx = 0, denominatorIdx = 0;
            int j = 1;
            
            // Iterate through the array to find fractions smaller than mid
            for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
                while (j < n && arr[i] >= mid * arr[j]) {
                    j++;
                }

                // Count smaller fractions
                totalSmallerFractions += (n - j);

                // If we have exhausted the array, break
                if (j == n) break;

                // Calculate the fraction
                double fraction = (double) arr[i] / arr[j];

                // Update maxFraction and indices if necessary
                if (fraction > maxFraction) {
                    numeratorIdx = i;
                    denominatorIdx = j;
                    maxFraction = fraction;
                }
            }

            // Check if we have found the kth smallest prime fraction
            if (totalSmallerFractions == k) {
                return new int[]{arr[numeratorIdx], arr[denominatorIdx]};
            } else if (totalSmallerFractions > k) {
                right = mid; // Adjust the range for binary search
            } else {
                left = mid; // Adjust the range for binary search
            }
        }
        return new int[]{}; // Return empty array if kth smallest prime fraction not found
    }
}
