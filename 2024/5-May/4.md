## Intuition
To minimize the number of boats needed, we can pair the lightest person with the heaviest person (if their weights allow) to maximize the utilization of each boat.

## Approach
1. Sort the array `people` in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize two pointers, `light` and `heavy`, to the start and end of the array respectively.
3. Initialize a variable `bt` to 0 to count the number of boats needed.
4. While `light` is less than or equal to `heavy`, do the following:
   - If the sum of the weights of the people at positions `light` and `heavy` is less than or equal to the limit, increment `light` and decrement `heavy` (as they can be paired together in a boat).
   - Otherwise, decrement `heavy` (as the heaviest person cannot be paired with anyone else due to the weight limit).
   - Increment `bt` after each iteration.
5. Return the value of `bt`, which represents the minimum number of boats needed.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of people. Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and the two-pointer approach takes O(n) time.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int light = 0, heavy = people.length - 1;
        int bt = 0;
        while (light <= heavy) {
            if (people[light] + people[heavy] <= limit) {
                heavy--;
                light++;
            } else {
                heavy--;
            }
            bt++;
        }
        return bt;
    }
}
