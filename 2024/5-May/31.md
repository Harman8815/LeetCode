# [Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-31)

## Intuition
1. **XOR Property**: XOR of a number with itself is 0, and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself. XOR is also commutative and associative.
2. **Finding the XOR of the two unique numbers**: XOR all the elements in the array. The result will be the XOR of the two unique numbers because the numbers appearing twice will cancel each other out.
3. **Finding a distinguishing bit**: Find any bit that is set in the XOR result. This bit must be different between the two unique numbers.
4. **Partitioning the array**: Use the distinguishing bit to partition the array into two groups. One group will have all numbers with the bit set, and the other group will have all numbers with the bit unset.
5. **Finding the unique numbers**: XOR the numbers in each group. The result will be the two unique numbers.

## Approach
1. Compute the XOR of all elements in the array.
2. Find the rightmost set bit in the XOR result.
3. Partition the numbers into two groups based on the rightmost set bit.
4. Compute the XOR of each group to get the two unique numbers.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Space complexity: O(1), using only a few extra variables.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int xor = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            xor ^= num;
        }

        int rightmostSetBit = xor & (-xor);
        int[] result = new int[2];
        for (int num : nums) {
            if ((num & rightmostSetBit) == 0) {
                result[0] ^= num;
            } else {
                result[1] ^= num;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
