# [Find Maximum K such that -K Exists in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-positive-integer-that-exists-with-its-negative/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-02)

## Intuition
To find the largest positive integer k such that -k also exists in the array, we can iterate through the array and use a HashSet to store the elements we have seen so far. For each element num, we check if -num exists in the HashSet. If it does, we update our answer with the maximum of the current answer and the absolute value of num.

## Approach
1. Initialize a HashSet `hs` to store the elements seen so far and an integer `ans` to -1 to store the maximum k found so far.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the array `nums`.
   - Add `num` to the HashSet `hs`.
   - Calculate -num and store it in a variable `k`.
   - If `hs` contains `k`, update `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and the absolute value of `num`.
3. Return `ans`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array nums. We iterate through each element once.
- Space complexity: O(n), for the HashSet hs which can store at most n elements.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxK(int[] nums) {
        HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<>();
        int ans = -1;
        for(int num : nums){
            hs.add(num);
            int k = num*(-1);
            if(hs.contains(k)){
                ans = Math.max(ans,Math.abs(num));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
