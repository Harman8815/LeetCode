## [Distribute Coins in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-18)

## Question
You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

## Approach
1. Use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
2. At each node, calculate the excess or deficit of coins.
3. Add the absolute value of excess or deficit to the total moves.
4. Return the excess or deficit of coins at the current node to its parent.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node once.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    private int moves;

    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        moves = 0;
        dfs(root);
        return moves;
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode current) {
        if (current == null)
            return 0;

        // Calculate the coins each subtree has available to exchange
        int leftCoins = dfs(current.left);
        int rightCoins = dfs(current.right);

        // Add the total number of exchanges to moves
        moves += Math.abs(leftCoins) + Math.abs(rightCoins);

        // The number of coins current has available to exchange
        return (current.val - 1) + leftCoins + rightCoins;
    }
}
```
