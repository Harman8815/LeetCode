# [Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-29)

## Intuition
To reduce a number represented in binary to 1, we need to consider the rules for even and odd numbers. We traverse the binary string from right to left:
- If the current bit is 1 (odd number), we need to add 1 (resulting in a carry) and then divide by 2.
- If the current bit is 0 (even number), we simply divide by 2.
By keeping track of the carry, we can determine the total number of operations needed.

## Approach
1. Initialize `operations` to 0 and `carry` to 0.
2. Traverse the binary string `s` from the last character to the second character (right to left).
   - Convert the current character to a numeric value and add the `carry`.
   - If the resulting digit is odd, increment `operations` by 2 and set `carry` to 1.
   - If the resulting digit is even, increment `operations` by 1.
3. After the loop, return `operations + carry`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the binary string `s`. We process each character once.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we use a fixed amount of additional space.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int numSteps(String s) {
        int N = s.length();

        int operations = 0;
        int carry = 0;
        for (int i = N - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            int digit = Character.getNumericValue(s.charAt(i)) + carry;

            if (digit % 2 == 1) {
                operations += 2;
                carry = 1;
            } else {
                operations++;
            }
        }

        return operations + carry;
    }
}
