## [Evaluate Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-boolean-binary-tree/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-16)

## Question
You are given the root of a full binary tree with the following properties:

Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True.
Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND.
The evaluation of a node is as follows:

- If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e., True or False.
- Otherwise, evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.

Return the boolean result of evaluating the root node.

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children.

A leaf node is a node that has zero children.

## Approach
1. If the root is null, return false.
2. If the root is a leaf node, return the boolean value of its value (1 for True, 0 for False).
3. Recursively evaluate the left and right subtrees.
4. If the root's value is 2 (OR), return the OR of the left and right subtree evaluations.
5. If the root's value is 3 (AND), return the AND of the left and right subtree evaluations.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node once.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean evaluateTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return false;
        
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            return root.val == 1;
        }
        
        boolean leftEval = evaluateTree(root.left);
        boolean rightEval = evaluateTree(root.right);
        
        if (root.val == 2) {
            return leftEval || rightEval;
        } else if (root.val == 3) {
            return leftEval && rightEval;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```
