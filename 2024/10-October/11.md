# [The Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-the-smallest-unoccupied-chair/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-11)

## Problem Description
There is a party where `n` friends numbered from `0` to `n - 1` are attending. There is an infinite number of chairs in this party that are numbered from `0` to infinity. When a friend arrives at the party, they sit on the unoccupied chair with the smallest number.

For example, if chairs `0`, `1`, and `5` are occupied when a friend comes, they will sit on chair number `2`. When a friend leaves the party, their chair becomes unoccupied at the moment they leave. If another friend arrives at that same moment, they can sit in that chair.

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `times` where `times[i] = [arrivali, leavingi]`, indicating the arrival and leaving times of the `i`th friend respectively, and an integer `targetFriend`. All arrival times are distinct.

Return the chair number that the friend numbered `targetFriend` will sit on.

### Example
- **Input**: `times = [[1,4],[2,3],[4,6]], targetFriend = 1`
  - **Output**: `1`
  - **Explanation**: 
    - Friend `0` arrives at time `1` and sits on chair `0`.
    - Friend `1` arrives at time `2` and sits on chair `1`.
    - Friend `1` leaves at time `3` and chair `1` becomes empty.
    - Friend `0` leaves at time `4` and chair `0` becomes empty.
    - Friend `2` arrives at time `4` and sits on chair `0`.
    - Since friend `1` sat on chair `1`, we return `1`.
  
- **Input**: `times = [[3,10],[1,5],[2,6]], targetFriend = 0`
  - **Output**: `2`
  - **Explanation**: 
    - Friend `1` arrives at time `1` and sits on chair `0`.
    - Friend `2` arrives at time `2` and sits on chair `1`.
    - Friend `0` arrives at time `3` and sits on chair `2`.
    - Friend `1` leaves at time `5` and chair `0` becomes empty.
    - Friend `2` leaves at time `6` and chair `1` becomes empty.
    - Friend `0` leaves at time `10` and chair `2` becomes empty.
    - Since friend `0` sat on chair `2`, we return `2`.

### Constraints
- `n == times.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^4`
- `times[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= arrivali < leavingi <= 10^5`
- `0 <= targetFriend <= n - 1`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Extract Target Time**: First, retrieve the arrival and leaving times of the `targetFriend`.
2. **Sort Times**: Sort the `times` array based on arrival times to process the friends in the order they arrive.
3. **Manage Chair Occupancy**: Create an array `chairTime` to track when each chair becomes available.
4. **Allocate Chairs**: For each friend, check the `chairTime` array to find the first available chair (one that is unoccupied when the friend arrives). Update that chair's time to the friend's leaving time.
5. **Return Target Chair**: If the current friend's times match the `targetFriend`, return the chair index.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of friends. In the worst case, for each friend, we may have to check all chairs.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the chair occupancy times.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestChair(int[][] times, int targetFriend) {
        int[] targetTime = times[targetFriend];
        Arrays.sort(times, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        int n = times.length;
        int[] chairTime = new int[n];

        for (int[] time : times) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (chairTime[i] <= time[0]) {
                    chairTime[i] = time[1];
                    if (Arrays.equals(time, targetTime)) return i;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
