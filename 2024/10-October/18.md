# [Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-maximum-bitwise-or-subsets/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-18)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, find the maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset of `nums` and return the number of different non-empty subsets that have this maximum bitwise OR.

- A **subset** of an array `a` can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of `a`.
- Two subsets are considered different if the indices of the elements chosen are different.

The bitwise OR of an array `a` is equal to:
```
a[0] OR a[1] OR ... OR a[a.length - 1]
```

### Example 1:

**Input**: `nums = [3,1]`  
**Output**: `2`  
**Explanation**: The maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset is 3. There are 2 subsets with a bitwise OR of 3:  
- `[3]`  
- `[3,1]`

### Example 2:

**Input**: `nums = [2,2,2]`  
**Output**: `7`  
**Explanation**: All non-empty subsets of `[2,2,2]` have a bitwise OR of 2. There are 7 non-empty subsets, which is `2^3 - 1 = 7`.

### Example 3:

**Input**: `nums = [3,2,1,5]`  
**Output**: `6`  
**Explanation**: The maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset is 7. There are 6 subsets with a bitwise OR of 7:  
- `[3,5]`  
- `[3,1,5]`  
- `[3,2,5]`  
- `[3,2,1,5]`  
- `[2,5]`  
- `[2,1,5]`

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 16`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach

1. **Maximum OR Calculation**:  
   First, calculate the maximum possible bitwise OR value by performing an OR operation across all the numbers in the array. This gives the maximum possible OR that any subset can achieve.

2. **Recursive Subset Count**:  
   We use a recursive approach to count the number of subsets that achieve the maximum OR. The recursive function explores two choices for each number:
   - **Exclude** the current number from the subset.
   - **Include** the current number in the subset and update the OR value.

3. **Base Case**:  
   When we reach the end of the array, we check if the current OR value matches the maximum OR value. If so, we count this subset as valid.

4. **Memoization**:  
   To avoid redundant calculations, memoization could be used, but since the problem has a small input size (at most 16 numbers), the recursive solution is feasible without optimization.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int countMaxOrSubsets(int[] nums) {
        int maxOrValue = 0;
        // Calculate the maximum possible OR value
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxOrValue |= num;
        }
        // Call the recursive function to count subsets with the maximum OR
        return countSubsets(nums, 0, 0, maxOrValue);
    }

    private int countSubsets(int[] nums, int index, int currentOr, int targetOr) {
        // Base case: Reached the end of the array
        if (index == nums.length) {
            return (currentOr == targetOr) ? 1 : 0;
        }

        // Don't include the current number
        int countWithout = countSubsets(nums, index + 1, currentOr, targetOr);

        // Include the current number
        int countWith = countSubsets(nums, index + 1, currentOr | nums[index], targetOr);

        // Return the sum of both cases
        return countWithout + countWith;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Maximum OR Value**:  
   The first loop computes the `maxOrValue` by OR-ing all the numbers in the array. This gives the maximum OR that any subset can achieve.

2. **Recursive Count Function**:  
   The `countSubsets` function is called recursively with the following parameters:
   - `index`: The current index of the number being considered.
   - `currentOr`: The OR value of the current subset being formed.
   - `targetOr`: The maximum OR value we want to achieve.

3. **Recursive Logic**:
   - For each element, we consider two cases: including or excluding the element from the subset.
   - If the current OR value matches the `targetOr`, we count that subset as valid.
   - We use the recursive approach to explore all possible subsets.

4. **Base Case**:  
   The base case checks if we've reached the end of the array. If the current OR value equals the maximum OR value, we return 1 (indicating a valid subset); otherwise, we return 0.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), where `n` is the length of the array. This is because there are 2^n possible subsets of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the recursive call stack (depth of recursion).

### Edge Cases

- **Single Element Array**: If `nums` has only one element, there is only one subset, which is the array itself.
- **Array with Identical Elements**: If all elements are the same, every subset will have the same OR value.
- **No Valid Subset**: If no subset can achieve the target OR (although in this problem, it's guaranteed that there will be at least one non-empty subset).
