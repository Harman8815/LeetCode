# [Sentence Similarity III](https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-iii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-06)

## Problem Description
You are given two strings `sentence1` and `sentence2`, each representing a sentence composed of words. Two sentences are considered similar if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence (possibly empty) inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. 

### Example
- **Input**: `sentence1 = "My name is Haley"`, `sentence2 = "My Haley"`
  - **Output**: `true`
  - **Explanation**: `sentence2` can be turned into `sentence1` by inserting "name is" between "My" and "Haley".

- **Input**: `sentence1 = "of"`, `sentence2 = "A lot of words"`
  - **Output**: `false`
  - **Explanation**: No single sentence can be inserted inside one of the sentences to make it equal to the other.

- **Input**: `sentence1 = "Eating right now"`, `sentence2 = "Eating"`
  - **Output**: `true`
  - **Explanation**: `sentence2` can be turned into `sentence1` by inserting "right now" at the end of the sentence.

### Constraints
- `1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 100`
- `sentence1` and `sentence2` consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces. 
- The words in `sentence1` and `sentence2` are separated by a single space.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Split Sentences**: Split both sentences into words and store them in deques for efficient access from both ends.
2. **Compare Prefixes**: Compare the words from the start of both sentences until they differ.
3. **Compare Suffixes**: Compare the words from the end of both sentences until they differ.
4. **Check Similarity**: After comparing, if one of the deques is empty, it means all remaining words in the other sentence can be considered as inserted words.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `sentence1` and `sentence2`, respectively.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for storing the words in the deques.

## Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Deque;

class Solution {
    public boolean areSentencesSimilar(String s1, String s2) {
        Deque<String> deque1 = new ArrayDeque<>(Arrays.asList(s1.split(" ")));
        Deque<String> deque2 = new ArrayDeque<>(Arrays.asList(s2.split(" ")));

        // Compare the prefixes or beginning of the strings.
        while (
            !deque1.isEmpty() &&
            !deque2.isEmpty() &&
            deque1.peek().equals(deque2.peek())
        ) {
            deque1.poll();
            deque2.poll();
        }
        // Compare the suffixes or ending of the strings.
        while (
            !deque1.isEmpty() &&
            !deque2.isEmpty() &&
            deque1.peekLast().equals(deque2.peekLast())
        ) {
            deque1.pollLast();
            deque2.pollLast();
        }
        return deque1.isEmpty() || deque2.isEmpty();
    }
}
