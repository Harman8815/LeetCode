### Problem: [Cousins in Binary Tree II](https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-23)

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to replace the value of each node with the sum of all its cousins' values. 

### Definitions:
- **Cousins**: Two nodes are cousins if they are at the same depth but have different parents.
- **Depth**: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root node to that node.

The solution should return the root of the modified tree.

### Example 1:

**Input**:  
`root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]`

**Output**:  
`[0,0,0,7,7,null,11]`

**Explanation**:  
- The initial tree is:
  ```
      5
     / \
    4   9
   / \   \
  1  10   7
  ```

- The modified tree is:
  ```
      0
     / \
    0   0
   / \   \
  7   7   11
  ```
- Node `5` has no cousins so its value becomes `0`.
- Node `4` has no cousins so its value becomes `0`.
- Node `9` has no cousins so its value becomes `0`.
- Node `1` has cousin `7`, so its value becomes `7`.
- Node `10` has cousin `7`, so its value becomes `7`.
- Node `7` has cousins `1` and `10`, so its value becomes `1 + 10 = 11`.

### Example 2:

**Input**:  
`root = [3,1,2]`

**Output**:  
`[0,0,0]`

**Explanation**:  
- The tree structure is:
  ```
      3
     / \
    1   2
  ```

- Since no node has cousins, all nodes are assigned the value `0`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
- The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `10^5`.

## Solution Approach

### Key Idea:
1. **Level Order Traversal (BFS)**: 
   We can use BFS to process each level of the binary tree. For each level, we need to calculate the sum of the cousins' values (the sum of all nodes at the same level, excluding the node itself).

2. **Replacement of Node Values**: 
   Once we calculate the sum of cousins for a node, we replace the value of the node with this sum.

3. **Tracking the Parent Nodes**: 
   Each node’s value is replaced by the sum of its cousins. To ensure the proper calculation, we need to sum the sibling nodes' values and then update the child nodes.

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize a `Queue` for BFS, starting with the root node.
2. For each level, compute the sum of the node values at that level.
3. Replace each node’s value by the sum of its cousins (the sum of all nodes in the same level minus the node’s own value).
4. Move to the next level and repeat until all nodes are processed.

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode replaceValueInTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return root;
        }

        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(root);  // Start BFS with the root node
        int prevSum = root.val;  // Initialize sum of root node

        // Perform level-order traversal
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();  // Number of nodes at the current level
            int curSum = 0;  // Sum of the current level

            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode node = q.poll();  // Dequeue node
                node.val = prevSum - node.val;  // Replace node's value with sum of its cousins

                // Calculate sum of the siblings (cousins' sum) at the current level
                int sibSum = 
                    (node.left != null ? node.left.val : 0) + 
                    (node.right != null ? node.right.val : 0);

                // Add children to the queue and update their values
                if (node.left != null) {
                    curSum += node.left.val;
                    node.left.val = sibSum;
                    q.offer(node.left);
                }
                if (node.right != null) {
                    curSum += node.right.val;
                    node.right.val = sibSum;
                    q.offer(node.right);
                }
            }

            // Update prevSum to be the sum of the current level
            prevSum = curSum;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **BFS Setup**:  
   We start by enqueueing the root node and initializing the sum of the root node.

2. **Level-wise Traversal**:  
   - We process each level one at a time.
   - For each node in the level, we calculate the sum of its cousins and update its value.
   - After processing a node, we enqueue its left and right children (if they exist) and update their values.

3. **Updating `prevSum`**:  
   After processing all nodes at the current level, we update the `prevSum` to be the sum of the nodes at the next level.

4. **Returning the Modified Tree**:  
   Finally, after all levels have been processed, the tree has been modified as required, and we return the root node.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. We traverse each node once and perform constant-time operations for each node.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing nodes in the queue during BFS.

### Edge Cases:
- A tree with only one node: The value of the root remains `0` since it has no cousins.
- A tree with a deep structure but few branches: The code handles trees with large depth efficiently.
