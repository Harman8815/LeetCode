## Problem Description

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, the binary string `Sn` is formed as follows:

- **S1 = "0"**
- **Si = Si-1 + "1" + reverse(invert(Si-1))** for **i > 1**

Where:
- "+" denotes the concatenation operation,
- `reverse(x)` returns the reversed string `x`,
- `invert(x)` inverts all the bits in `x` (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0).

Return the kth bit in `Sn`. It is guaranteed that `k` is valid for the given `n`.

### Example 1:

**Input**: `n = 3`, `k = 1`  
**Output**: `"0"`  
**Explanation**: `S3` is `"0111001"`. The 1st bit is `"0"`.

### Example 2:

**Input**: `n = 4`, `k = 11`  
**Output**: `"1"`  
**Explanation**: `S4` is `"011100110110001"`. The 11th bit is `"1"`.

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `1 <= k <= 2^n - 1`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach

The binary string `Sn` is built recursively, but rather than constructing the entire string, we can use recursion to navigate and determine the value of the `k`-th bit directly.

#### Key Observations:

1. The string `Si` has a length of `2^i - 1`, and the structure of `Si` is:
   ```
   Si = Si-1 + "1" + reverse(invert(Si-1))
   ```
2. We can break down the problem recursively by considering the following:
   - If `k` is in the first half of `Si`, it corresponds to the `k`-th bit of `Si-1`.
   - If `k` is exactly in the middle, the value is `"1"`.
   - If `k` is in the second half of `Si`, it corresponds to the bit in the first half of `Si-1`, but inverted.

#### Recursive Approach:
- **Base Case**: For `S1`, the string is simply `"0"`, so return `'0'`.
- **Recursive Case**:
  - If `k` is in the first half of `Si`, recurse with `n-1` and the same `k`.
  - If `k` is exactly in the middle, return `'1'`.
  - If `k` is in the second half, compute the mirrored index in the first half, and invert the result.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public char findKthBit(int n, int k) {
        // Base case: for S1, return '0'
        if (n == 1) return '0';

        // Calculate the length of Sn
        int len = 1 << n; // Equivalent to 2^n

        // If k is in the first half of the string, recurse with n-1
        if (k < len / 2) {
            return findKthBit(n - 1, k);
        }
        // If k is exactly in the middle, return '1'
        else if (k == len / 2) {
            return '1';
        }
        // If k is in the second half of the string
        else {
            // Find the corresponding bit in the first half and invert it
            char correspondingBit = findKthBit(n - 1, len - k);
            return (correspondingBit == '0') ? '1' : '0';
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: If `n == 1`, return `'0'` because `S1` is just `"0"`.
2. **Calculate Length**: The length of `Sn` is `2^n`. We use `1 << n` to compute `2^n` efficiently.
3. **First Half**: If `k` is less than the midpoint (`len / 2`), recursively find the `k`-th bit in the first half, which corresponds to `Si-1`.
4. **Middle Bit**: If `k` is exactly the middle, return `'1'` as per the string construction rule.
5. **Second Half**: If `k` is in the second half, find the corresponding bit in the first half (`len - k`), then invert it.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the input size. The recursion reduces the problem size by half at each step, leading to a depth of `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to the recursive call stack.

### Edge Cases:

- **Minimum Input**: For `n = 1`, the result is trivially `"0"`.
- **Large k**: The solution works efficiently even for large `k` due to the recursive structure that doesn't require constructing large strings.
