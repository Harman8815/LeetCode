# [Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-intervals-into-minimum-number-of-groups/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-12)

## Problem Description
You are given a 2D integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` represents the inclusive interval `[lefti, righti]`.

You have to divide the intervals into one or more groups such that each interval is in exactly one group, and no two intervals that are in the same group intersect each other.

Return the minimum number of groups you need to make.

Two intervals intersect if there is at least one common number between them. For example, the intervals `[1, 5]` and `[5, 8]` intersect.

### Example
- **Input**: `intervals = [[5,10],[6,8],[1,5],[2,3],[1,10]]`
  - **Output**: `3`
  - **Explanation**: 
    - We can divide the intervals into the following groups:
      - Group 1: `[1, 5]`, `[6, 8]`.
      - Group 2: `[2, 3]`, `[5, 10]`.
      - Group 3: `[1, 10]`.
    - It can be proven that it is not possible to divide the intervals into fewer than `3` groups.
  
- **Input**: `intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10],[11,13]]`
  - **Output**: `1`
  - **Explanation**: None of the intervals overlap, so we can put all of them in one group.

### Constraints
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 10^6`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Separate Start and End Points**: Create two arrays, `begin` and `end`, to store the start and end points of the intervals respectively.
2. **Sort Both Arrays**: Sort the `begin` and `end` arrays to facilitate the grouping process.
3. **Count Groups**: Use two pointers to iterate through the `begin` and `end` arrays:
   - If the start of the current interval (`begin[i]`) is less than or equal to the end of the current interval (`end[j]`), it indicates that there is an overlap, and thus a new group is required (increment the result counter).
   - Otherwise, move the end pointer forward since that interval has finished.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting of both arrays, where n is the number of intervals.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the additional arrays used to store the start and end points.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minGroups(int[][] mx) {
        int n = mx.length;
        int[] begin = new int[n], end = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            begin[i] = mx[i][0];
            end[i] = mx[i][1];
        }
        Arrays.sort(begin);
        Arrays.sort(end);
        
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (begin[i] <= end[j]) res++;
            else j++;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
