### Problem: [Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-of-binary-tree-after-subtree-removal-queries/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-26)

## Problem Description

You are given the root of a binary tree and a list of queries. In each query, you remove the subtree rooted at the node specified by the query. After each query, you need to return the height of the tree, which is defined as the number of edges in the longest path from the root to any node.

### Key Points:
- **Subtree Removal**: Removing a subtree means that the node and all its descendants are removed.
- **Queries**: Each query specifies a node whose subtree is to be removed.
- **Tree Rebuilding**: After each query, the tree is assumed to return to its original state.

### Constraints:
- The tree contains `n` nodes, with `2 <= n <= 10^5`.
- There are `m` queries, where `1 <= m <= min(n, 10^4)`.
- Each query asks for the removal of a subtree at a node, but the node in the query is not the root of the tree.

### Approach:

To solve the problem efficiently, we need to find the height of the tree after removing the subtree rooted at any given node. Since recalculating the entire tree height from scratch for each query would be inefficient, we can take advantage of precomputed values.

### Solution Outline:
1. **Precompute the Heights**:
   - First, we need to compute the height of the tree from the root and store the heights of each node. This helps in knowing how deep each node is in the original tree.
   
2. **Store the Maximum Heights**:
   - For each node, we should compute what the tree height would be if the node was removed. This involves considering the heights of the left and right subtrees of each node. Specifically:
     - If a node is removed, the new tree height is the maximum height of the two subtrees that would remain.
   
3. **Process Queries**:
   - After precomputing the heights, for each query, the result will be the stored value for the height of the tree after the removal of the queried node's subtree.

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    
    // Array to store the maximum height of the tree after removing each node
    static final int[] maxHeightAfterRemoval = new int[100001];
    
    int currentMaxHeight = 0;
    
    public int[] treeQueries(TreeNode root, int[] queries) {
        // First pass to compute the height of the tree and store heights
        traverseLeftToRight(root, 0);
        
        // Reset the maxHeight for second traversal
        currentMaxHeight = 0;
        
        // Second pass to compute maximum heights after removing each node's subtree
        traverseRightToLeft(root, 0);
        
        // Process queries and build the result array
        int queryCount = queries.length;
        int[] queryResults = new int[queryCount];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < queryCount; i++) {
            queryResults[i] = maxHeightAfterRemoval[queries[i]];
        }

        return queryResults;
    }
    
    // First traversal (left to right) to update max height after removal for each node
    private void traverseLeftToRight(TreeNode node, int currentHeight) {
        if (node == null) return;

        // Store the maximum height if this node were removed
        maxHeightAfterRemoval[node.val] = currentMaxHeight;

        // Update the current maximum height
        currentMaxHeight = Math.max(currentMaxHeight, currentHeight);

        // Traverse the left and right subtrees
        traverseLeftToRight(node.left, currentHeight + 1);
        traverseLeftToRight(node.right, currentHeight + 1);
    }
    
    // Second traversal (right to left) to finalize max height after removal for each node
    private void traverseRightToLeft(TreeNode node, int currentHeight) {
        if (node == null) return;

        // Update the maximum height if this node were removed
        maxHeightAfterRemoval[node.val] = Math.max(
            maxHeightAfterRemoval[node.val],
            currentMaxHeight
        );

        // Update the current maximum height
        currentMaxHeight = Math.max(currentHeight, currentMaxHeight);

        // Traverse the right and left subtrees
        traverseRightToLeft(node.right, currentHeight + 1);
        traverseRightToLeft(node.left, currentHeight + 1);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Height Calculation**:
   - We start by calculating the height of the tree and storing the maximum height after removing each node's subtree.
   - The two passes (left-to-right and right-to-left) ensure that we efficiently compute the maximum height that would remain after removing each node.

2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
   - In this pass, we store the current maximum height for each node's subtree removal and update the `currentMaxHeight` as we traverse left-to-right through the tree.

3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
   - This pass completes the calculation of the maximum height for each node after its subtree is removed, taking into account the right subtree and the left subtree heights.

4. **Answering Queries**:
   - After precomputing the heights, answering the queries becomes a simple lookup operation in the `maxHeightAfterRemoval` array.

### Time Complexity:
- **Preprocessing the Tree**:  
  The two passes through the tree take `O(n)` time where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
  
- **Answering Queries**:  
  Each query is answered in constant time `O(1)` by looking up the value in the `maxHeightAfterRemoval` array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
- **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree and `m` is the number of queries.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We store the maximum heights in an array of size `n`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Small Trees**: Trees with just a few nodes should work without any issues since the query results are computed based on subtree removals.
  
- **Large Queries**: Since the queries are independent and we have precomputed the results, the solution efficiently handles a large number of queries.

This approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently, even for large inputs, adhering to the problem's constraints.
