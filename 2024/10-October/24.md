### Problem: [Flip Equivalent Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-equivalent-binary-trees/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-24)

## Problem Description

We are given two binary trees `root1` and `root2`. We can perform a flip operation on a node where we swap its left and right children. The problem asks whether it is possible to make the two trees equivalent by performing any number of flips.

### Conditions for Flip Equivalence:
- Two binary trees are flip equivalent if we can make the trees equal after performing some flip operations.
- A flip operation involves choosing any node and swapping its left and right child subtrees.

### Input and Output:
- **Input**: The roots of two binary trees `root1` and `root2`.
- **Output**: Return `true` if the trees are flip equivalent, otherwise `false`.

### Example 1:

**Input**:  
`root1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8]`  
`root2 = [1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]`

**Output**:  
`true`

**Explanation**:  
We flipped the trees at nodes with values `1`, `3`, and `5` to make them equal.

### Example 2:

**Input**:  
`root1 = []`  
`root2 = []`

**Output**:  
`true`

**Explanation**:  
Both trees are empty, so they are trivially flip equivalent.

### Example 3:

**Input**:  
`root1 = []`  
`root2 = [1]`

**Output**:  
`false`

**Explanation**:  
One tree is empty, and the other has a node, so they cannot be flip equivalent.

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in each tree is between `0` and `100`.
- Each node has a unique value in the range `[0, 99]`.

## Solution Approach

### Key Idea:
To determine whether two trees are flip equivalent, we need to recursively check if the subtrees can be made identical either by flipping them or not.

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If both nodes are `null`, they are trivially equivalent.
   - If one of the nodes is `null` and the other is not, they cannot be equivalent.
   - If the values of the nodes do not match, they cannot be equivalent.

2. **Recursive Check**:
   - We need to check two possible conditions:
     1. **Without flipping**: Both the left and right subtrees of `root1` and `root2` should be equivalent.
     2. **With flipping**: The left subtree of `root1` should match the right subtree of `root2`, and vice versa.

3. **Return the result**:  
   If either of the above conditions is true, the trees are flip equivalent.

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean flipEquiv(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        // If both nodes are null, they are flip equivalent
        if (root1 == null && root2 == null) return true;
        
        // If one of the nodes is null or the values do not match, they are not flip equivalent
        if (root1 == null || root2 == null || root1.val != root2.val) return false;

        // Check both conditions: without flip and with flip
        boolean withoutFlip = flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.left) && flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.right);
        boolean withFlip = flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.right) && flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.left);
        
        // Return true if either condition holds
        return withoutFlip || withFlip;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**:
   - If both nodes are `null`, they are equivalent (`true`).
   - If one node is `null` and the other is not, they are not equivalent (`false`).
   - If the values of the nodes do not match, they are not equivalent (`false`).

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - We recursively check both:
     - Whether the left and right subtrees match without flipping (`withoutFlip`).
     - Whether the left and right subtrees match after flipping (`withFlip`).

3. **Final Check**:
   - If either the `withoutFlip` or `withFlip` condition is `true`, the trees are flip equivalent.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the trees. We visit each node at most twice.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursion stack used during traversal.

### Edge Cases:
- Both trees are empty (`[]`): Return `true` because two empty trees are trivially flip equivalent.
- One tree is empty and the other is not (`[]` vs `[1]`): Return `false` because an empty tree cannot be flip equivalent to a non-empty one.
- Trees with different values or structures: Return `false` if there is any mismatch in values or structure.

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the given constraints.
