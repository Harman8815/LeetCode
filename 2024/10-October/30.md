### Problem: [Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-removals-to-make-mountain-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-30)

## Problem Description:

A **mountain array** is defined as an array where:
- The length of the array is at least 3.
- There exists an index `i` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i+1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given an integer array `nums`, your task is to return the minimum number of elements to remove from `nums` to make it a mountain array.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 3, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
The array itself is already a mountain array, so no elements need to be removed.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
nums = [2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
One possible solution is to remove the elements at indices 0, 1, and 5, which results in the array `nums = [1, 5, 6, 3, 1]`.

### Constraints:
- `3 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- It is guaranteed that you can make a mountain array out of `nums`.

### Approach:

To solve this problem, we need to focus on finding the longest subsequence in the array that can be considered a "mountain," i.e., an increasing subsequence followed by a decreasing subsequence. To do this efficiently, we can utilize dynamic programming (DP) to compute two key sequences for each element in the array:
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** ending at each index.
- **Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS)** starting at each index.

The basic idea is:
1. Compute the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) that ends at each index.
2. Compute the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) that starts at each index.
3. For each index, check if it can be the peak of a mountain (i.e., if both LIS and LDS are greater than 1).
4. Minimize the number of removals by calculating the number of elements that are not part of the longest mountain subsequence.

### Steps:
1. Compute the LIS for each index `i` such that `i` is the end of the subsequence.
2. Compute the LDS for each index `i` such that `i` is the start of the subsequence.
3. For each index, if it can serve as a peak, compute the number of removals as:
   ```
   removals = N - lis[i] - lds[i] + 1
   ```
   where `N` is the length of the array.
4. Track the minimum removals.

### Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {

    public int minimumMountainRemovals(int[] nums) {
        int N = nums.length;

        int[] lisLength = new int[N];
        int[] ldsLength = new int[N];

        Arrays.fill(lisLength, 1);
        Arrays.fill(ldsLength, 1);

        // Compute LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence) for each index
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    lisLength[i] = Math.max(lisLength[i], lisLength[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // Compute LDS (Longest Decreasing Subsequence) for each index
        for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    ldsLength[i] = Math.max(ldsLength[i], ldsLength[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // Calculate the minimum number of removals required
        int minRemovals = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (lisLength[i] > 1 && ldsLength[i] > 1) {
                minRemovals = Math.min(minRemovals, N - lisLength[i] - ldsLength[i] + 1);
            }
        }

        return minRemovals;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `lisLength[i]`: Stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at index `i`.
   - `ldsLength[i]`: Stores the length of the longest decreasing subsequence that starts at index `i`.

2. **LIS Calculation**:
   - For each element at index `i`, we check all previous elements (from 0 to `i-1`). If the element at `i` is greater than the element at `j`, we update the `lisLength[i]`.

3. **LDS Calculation**:
   - For each element at index `i`, we check all subsequent elements (from `i+1` to `N-1`). If the element at `i` is greater than the element at `j`, we update the `ldsLength[i]`.

4. **Minimizing Removals**:
   - We iterate through each index `i`. If both `lisLength[i] > 1` and `ldsLength[i] > 1`, it indicates that `i` can be a valid peak. We compute the removals required to form the mountain as:
   ```
   removals = N - lisLength[i] - ldsLength[i] + 1
   ```
   The `+1` is to account for the peak element that is counted twice.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - The answer is the minimum number of removals across all valid peaks.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N^2)** where `N` is the length of the array. This is because for each element, we potentially check all other elements to compute the LIS and LDS.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(N)** for storing the LIS and LDS arrays.

### Conclusion:
This approach efficiently calculates the minimum number of removals to make the array a mountain array using dynamic programming for the LIS and LDS calculations.
