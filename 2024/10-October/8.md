# [Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-string-balanced/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-08)

## Problem Description
You are given a 0-indexed string `s` of even length `n`, consisting of exactly `n / 2` opening brackets `[` and `n / 2` closing brackets `]`. The goal is to return the minimum number of swaps required to make the string balanced.

A string is considered balanced if:
1. It is the empty string, or
2. It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
3. It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.

### Example
- **Input**: `s = "][]["`
  - **Output**: `1`
  - **Explanation**: You can swap index 0 with index 3 to make the string balanced: resulting in "[[]]".

- **Input**: `s = "]]][[["`
  - **Output**: `2`
  - **Explanation**: Swap index 0 with index 4, and then index 1 with index 5 to achieve "[[][]]".

- **Input**: `s = "[]"`
  - **Output**: `0`
  - **Explanation**: The string is already balanced.

### Constraints
- `n == s.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^6`
- `n` is even.
- `s[i]` is either `[` or `]`.
- The number of opening brackets `[` equals `n / 2`, and the number of closing brackets `]` equals `n / 2`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**: Use an integer `open` to keep track of the balance of opening brackets and an integer `ans` to count the number of swaps needed.
2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through each character in the string:
   - If the character is `]` and there are unmatched `[` (i.e., `open > 0`), decrement `open`.
   - If the character is `]` and there are no unmatched `[`, increment `ans` and increment `open` (to simulate a new unmatched `[`).
   - If the character is `[`, increment `open`.
3. **Return the Count**: After the loop, `ans` will contain the minimum number of swaps needed to balance the string.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, since we process each character once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        int open = 0, ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == ']') {
                if (open > 0)
                    open--;
                else {
                    ans++;
                    open++;
                }
            } else {
                open++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
