# [Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-09)

## Problem Description
A parentheses string is valid if and only if:
1. It is the empty string,
2. It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
3. It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

You are given a parentheses string `s`. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make `s` valid.

### Example
- **Input**: `s = "())"`
  - **Output**: `1`
- **Input**: `s = "((("`
  - **Output**: `3`

### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `(` or `)`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Use a Stack**: Initialize a stack to keep track of opening parentheses `(`.
2. **Count Invalid Parentheses**: Initialize a counter `ans` to count the minimum moves required:
   - Iterate through each character in the string:
     - If the character is `(`, push it onto the stack.
     - If the character is `)`, check:
       - If the stack is not empty and the top is `(`, pop the stack (indicating a valid pair).
       - If the stack is empty, increment the `ans` counter (indicating an unmatched closing parenthesis).
3. **Final Count**: After processing the string, the remaining elements in the stack represent unmatched opening parentheses. The final answer is the sum of `ans` and the size of the stack.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, since we process each character once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, for the stack to store unmatched opening parentheses.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minAddToMakeValid(String s) {
        Stack<Character> st = new Stack<>();
        int ans = 0;
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '(') st.push(ch);
            else {
                if (!st.isEmpty() && st.peek() == '(') st.pop();
                else ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans + st.size();
    }
}
