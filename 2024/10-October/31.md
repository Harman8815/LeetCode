### Problem: [Minimum Total Distance Traveled](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-distance-traveled/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-31)

## Problem Description:

You are given:
- A list of robots' positions, `robot[i]`, which indicates the position of the `i`-th robot.
- A 2D list `factory[j]` where `factory[j] = [positionj, limitj]` means that the `j`-th factory is located at `positionj` and can repair at most `limitj` robots.

The robots move in one direction, and you want to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots to be repaired by the factories.

### Constraints:
- Robots and factories move at the same speed.
- If robots move in opposite directions, they do not collide but cross each other.
- A robot can be repaired by a factory only if it reaches that factory, and the factory hasnâ€™t reached its limit of repairs.
- The positions of the robots and factories are unique, and the problem guarantees that every robot can be repaired.

You are tasked with returning the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
robot = [0, 4, 6]
factory = [[2, 2], [6, 2]]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
4
```

**Explanation:**
- The first robot moves towards the first factory at position 2 (distance = |2 - 0| = 2).
- The second robot moves towards the first factory at position 2 (distance = |2 - 4| = 2).
- The third robot is already at the second factory at position 6 (distance = |6 - 6| = 0).
Total distance = 2 + 2 + 0 = 4.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
robot = [1, -1]
factory = [[-2, 1], [2, 1]]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The first robot moves towards the second factory at position 2 (distance = |2 - 1| = 1).
- The second robot moves towards the first factory at position -2 (distance = |-2 - (-1)| = 1).
Total distance = 1 + 1 = 2.

### Approach:

This problem can be approached using **dynamic programming (DP)** with **memoization**. The strategy involves assigning robots to factories in a way that minimizes the total distance. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sorting the Robots and Factories**:
   - First, sort both the robots and factories by their positions to ensure we process them in an orderly manner.

2. **Flattening the Factory List**:
   - For each factory, if it has a limit greater than 1, we add multiple instances of that factory to a new list to represent its capacity.

3. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - We define a recursive function `calculateMinDistance` that computes the minimum distance for a given robot and factory combination. This function will use memoization to store intermediate results for faster computation.
   - The recursive states involve either:
     - Assigning a robot to a factory (which increases the distance) and moving to the next robot and factory.
     - Skipping a factory for the current robot and trying the next factory.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If all robots have been assigned, return `0` (no more distance to be traveled).
   - If there are no factories left but robots remain, return a very large number (`1e12`), which represents an infeasible scenario.

### Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public long minimumTotalDistance(List<Integer> robot, int[][] factory) {
        // Sort robots and factories by position
        Collections.sort(robot);
        Arrays.sort(factory, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        // Flatten factory positions according to their capacities
        List<Integer> factoryPositions = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] f : factory) {
            for (int i = 0; i < f[1]; i++) {
                factoryPositions.add(f[0]);
            }
        }

        int robotCount = robot.size();
        int factoryCount = factoryPositions.size();
        long[][] memo = new long[robotCount][factoryCount];
        for (long[] row : memo) Arrays.fill(row, -1);

        // Recursively calculate minimum total distance with memoization
        return calculateMinDistance(0, 0, robot, factoryPositions, memo);
    }

    private long calculateMinDistance(
        int robotIdx,
        int factoryIdx,
        List<Integer> robot,
        List<Integer> factoryPositions,
        long[][] memo
    ) {
        // All robots assigned
        if (robotIdx == robot.size()) return 0;
        // No factories left to assign
        if (factoryIdx == factoryPositions.size()) return (long) 1e12;
        // Check memo
        if (memo[robotIdx][factoryIdx] != -1) return memo[robotIdx][factoryIdx];

        // Option 1: Assign current robot to current factory
        long assign =
            Math.abs(robot.get(robotIdx) - factoryPositions.get(factoryIdx)) +
            calculateMinDistance(
                robotIdx + 1,
                factoryIdx + 1,
                robot,
                factoryPositions,
                memo
            );

        // Option 2: Skip current factory for the current robot
        long skip = calculateMinDistance(
            robotIdx,
            factoryIdx + 1,
            robot,
            factoryPositions,
            memo
        );

        // Take the minimum and store in memo
        memo[robotIdx][factoryIdx] = Math.min(assign, skip);
        return memo[robotIdx][factoryIdx];
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**:
   - We first sort the robot positions and factory positions to ensure they are in increasing order, making it easier to assign robots to factories in a straightforward manner.

2. **Memoization**:
   - We use a 2D array `memo` where `memo[robotIdx][factoryIdx]` stores the minimum distance calculated for the given state of robot and factory indices.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - The function `calculateMinDistance` computes the minimal distance recursively, trying to assign each robot to a factory. We have two options for each robot: either assign it to the current factory or skip the current factory and try the next one.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - When all robots have been assigned, the total distance is `0`.
   - When there are no more factories to assign robots to, return a large number (`1e12`) to signify that this path is invalid.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The function returns the minimum distance calculated from all possible robot-to-factory assignments.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the robots and factories takes `O(R log R)` and `O(F log F)` respectively, where `R` is the number of robots and `F` is the number of factories.
- The dynamic programming part will have a time complexity of `O(R * F)`, where each state in the memoization table is computed once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
```
O(R log R + F log F + R * F)
```

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is `O(R * F)` due to the memoization table storing intermediate results.

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently solves the problem by leveraging sorting and dynamic programming with memoization to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.
