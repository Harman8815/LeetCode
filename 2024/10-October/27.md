### Problem: [Count Square Submatrices with All Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-27)

## Problem Description:

Given a `m x n` matrix filled with `0`s and `1`s, you need to return the number of square submatrices that have all ones. A square submatrix is a subset of the matrix where all the elements in that subset are `1`.

### Example:

**Input**: 
```
matrix = [
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
```
**Output**: `15`

Explanation:
- There are 10 squares of side 1.
- There are 4 squares of side 2.
- There is 1 square of side 3.
Thus, the total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.

**Input**:
```
matrix = [
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0]
]
```
**Output**: `7`

Explanation:
- There are 6 squares of side 1.
- There is 1 square of side 2.
Thus, the total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.

### Approach:

This problem can be solved using **Dynamic Programming** (DP). The main idea is to maintain a DP table where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square submatrix whose bottom-right corner is at `(i, j)`.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - If a cell in the matrix is `0`, the largest square submatrix ending at that cell is of size 0. 
   - If the cell is `1`, then we can form a square submatrix, and the size of the square depends on the sizes of squares that can be formed in the adjacent cells to the left, top, and top-left diagonal.

2. **DP Recurrence**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, if `matrix[i][j] == 1`, then:
     ```
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
     ```
   - The reason for this is that the largest square ending at `(i, j)` depends on the smallest square that can be formed by extending from the top, left, and diagonal cells.

3. **Counting Squares**:
   - The number of squares with a bottom-right corner at `(i, j)` is exactly `dp[i][j]`. So, for every cell `(i, j)`, you add `dp[i][j]` to a running total.

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSquares(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int m = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];
        int ans = 0;

        // Initialize the dp array and count squares for the first row and first column
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0];
            ans += dp[i][0];
        }

        for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j];
            ans += dp[0][j];
        }

        // Fill the dp array for the rest of the matrix
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(Math.min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j]), dp[i-1][j-1]);
                }
                ans += dp[i][j];  // Add the number of squares ending at (i, j)
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **DP Initialization**:
   - We initialize the first row and first column of the `dp` table directly from the `matrix`. If `matrix[i][j]` is `1`, the `dp[i][j]` will also be `1` (since it represents a square of side 1).
   
2. **DP Recurrence**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` from `i = 1` to `n-1` and `j = 1` to `m-1`, we check if `matrix[i][j] == 1`. If it is, we compute `dp[i][j]` using the formula:
     ```java
     dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(Math.min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j]), dp[i-1][j-1]);
     ```
     This ensures that `dp[i][j]` holds the size of the largest square submatrix with bottom-right corner at `(i, j)`.

3. **Counting Squares**:
   - As we populate the `dp` table, we sum the values of `dp[i][j]` at each step because `dp[i][j]` represents the number of square submatrices with bottom-right corner at `(i, j)`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n * m)** where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we iterate through the entire matrix once to fill the `dp` table and compute the result.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n * m)** for the `dp` table. This is required to store the largest square size at each cell.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Zeros**: If the matrix contains only zeros, the answer will be `0` since no square submatrices with all ones exist.
- **All Ones**: If the matrix contains all ones, the result will be the sum of all possible square submatrices.
