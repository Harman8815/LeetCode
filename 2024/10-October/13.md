# [Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-covering-elements-from-k-lists/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-13)

## Problem Description
You have `k` lists of sorted integers in non-decreasing order. The task is to find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

A range `[a, b]` is smaller than a range `[c, d]` if:
- `b - a < d - c`, or
- `a < c` if `b - a == d - c`.

### Example
- **Input**: `nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]`
- **Output**: `[20, 24]`
- **Explanation**:
  - List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24, 26], 24 is in range `[20, 24]`.
  - List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range `[20, 24]`.
  - List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range `[20, 24]`.

- **Input**: `nums = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]`
- **Output**: `[1, 1]`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Merge All Lists**: Merge all `k` lists into a single list of pairs, where each pair contains an element and its respective list index. This will allow us to track which list the element came from.
2. **Sort the Merged List**: Sort the merged list by the element value. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest range.
3. **Sliding Window with Frequency Count**: Use a sliding window approach where we maintain a frequency count of the lists currently in the window:
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to include a new element.
   - If all `k` lists are represented in the window, check if the current range is smaller than the previous smallest range.
   - Shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer to exclude elements from the left, ensuring that the window still contains at least one element from each list.
4. **Return the Smallest Range**: After processing the entire merged list, the smallest range will be stored.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where N is the total number of elements across all `k` lists. The sorting step dominates the complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the total number of elements, due to the space used by the merged list and frequency map.

```java

class Solution {
    public int[] smallestRange(List<List<Integer>> nums) {
        List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
        // Merge all lists into a single list of pairs (value, list index)
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            for (int j : nums.get(i)) {
                merged.add(new int[] { j, i });
            }
        }
        
        // Sort the merged list by value
        merged.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        int left = 0, count = 0;
        int rangeStart = 0, rangeEnd = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Sliding window approach
        for (int right = 0; right < merged.size(); right++) {
            int group = merged.get(right)[1];
            freq.put(group, freq.getOrDefault(group, 0) + 1);
            
            // If we have one element from each list, try to shrink the window
            if (freq.get(group) == 1) {
                count++;
            }
            
            while (count == nums.size()) {
                // Update the smallest range if current range is smaller
                int curRange = merged.get(right)[0] - merged.get(left)[0];
                if (curRange < rangeEnd - rangeStart) {
                    rangeStart = merged.get(left)[0];
                    rangeEnd = merged.get(right)[0];
                }
                
                // Shrink the window by moving left pointer
                int leftGroup = merged.get(left)[1];
                freq.put(leftGroup, freq.get(leftGroup) - 1);
                if (freq.get(leftGroup) == 0) {
                    count--;
                }
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return new int[] { rangeStart, rangeEnd };
    }
}
