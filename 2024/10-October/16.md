# [Longest Happy String](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-string/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-16)

## Problem Description
A string `s` is called **happy** if:
- It only contains the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
- It does not contain any of the substrings "aaa", "bbb", or "ccc".
- The string contains at most `a` occurrences of the letter 'a', at most `b` occurrences of the letter 'b', and at most `c` occurrences of the letter 'c'.

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the **longest** possible happy string. If there are multiple longest happy strings, return any of them. If no valid string is possible, return an empty string.

### Example
- **Input**: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 7`
- **Output**: `"ccaccbcc"`
- **Explanation**: There are multiple valid outputs, such as `"ccbccacc"`.
  
- **Input**: `a = 7, b = 1, c = 0`
- **Output**: `"aabaa"`
- **Explanation**: This is the only valid output.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Greedy Strategy**: Since the string must be as long as possible while respecting the constraints, a greedy approach is used where we always try to append the character with the highest remaining count, ensuring no three consecutive characters are the same.
  
2. **Avoid "aaa", "bbb", or "ccc"**: To maintain the condition that no character appears more than twice consecutively, we need to track how many times each character has been added consecutively. If we have added a character twice, we switch to the other character with the highest remaining count.

3. **Decision Making**: We decide which character to append based on:
   - The remaining count of the characters.
   - The current consecutive counts to ensure we don't exceed two consecutive occurrences of any character.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestDiverseString(int a, int b, int c) {
        int curra = 0, currb = 0, currc = 0;
        int totalIterations = a + b + c;
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < totalIterations; i++) {
            if ((a >= b && a >= c && curra != 2) || (a > 0 && (currb == 2 || currc == 2))) {
                ans.append('a');
                a--;
                curra++;
                currb = 0;
                currc = 0;
            } else if ((b >= a && b >= c && currb != 2) || (b > 0 && (currc == 2 || curra == 2))) {
                ans.append('b');
                b--;
                currb++;
                curra = 0;
                currc = 0;
            } else if ((c >= a && c >= b && currc != 2) || (c > 0 && (curra == 2 || currb == 2))) {
                ans.append('c');
                c--;
                currc++;
                curra = 0;
                currb = 0;
            }
        }
        return ans.toString();
    }
}
