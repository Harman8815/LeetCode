## Problem Description

You are given the root of a binary tree and a positive integer `k`. The task is to return the `k`-th largest sum among all levels in the binary tree. The **level sum** of a binary tree is the sum of the node values at the same level. 

- If there are fewer than `k` levels, return `-1`.
- Two nodes are on the same level if they have the same distance from the root.

### Example 1:

**Input**:  
`root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6]`,  
`k = 2`

**Output**:  
`13`

**Explanation**:  
The level sums are the following:
- Level 1: `5`
- Level 2: `8 + 9 = 17`
- Level 3: `2 + 1 + 3 + 7 = 13`
- Level 4: `4 + 6 = 10`

The 2nd largest level sum is `13`.

### Example 2:

**Input**:  
`root = [1,2,null,3]`,  
`k = 1`

**Output**:  
`3`

**Explanation**:  
The largest level sum is `3`.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= n <= 10^5` (number of nodes in the tree)
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^6`
- `1 <= k <= n`

## Solution Explanation

The goal is to calculate the sum of node values at each level and find the `k`-th largest sum. This can be accomplished using **breadth-first search (BFS)** to traverse each level of the tree. We store the sum of each level, then sort the sums in descending order to find the `k`-th largest sum.

### Approach

1. **BFS for Level Order Traversal**:  
   Perform a level-order traversal (BFS) to compute the sum of nodes at each level. We use a `Queue` to process nodes level by level.

2. **Store Level Sums**:  
   At each level, we calculate the sum of node values and store it in a list.

3. **Sort the Sums**:  
   After gathering all level sums, sort them in descending order.

4. **Return the K-th Largest Sum**:  
   Return the `k`-th largest sum from the sorted list of sums. If there are fewer than `k` levels, return `-1`.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public long kthLargestLevelSum(TreeNode root, int k) {
        List<Long> res = new ArrayList<>();  // To store sum of each level
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();  // Queue for level-order traversal
        q.add(root);  // Start BFS from the root node

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int n = q.size();  // Number of nodes at the current level
            long sum = 0;  // Sum of node values at the current level
            
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                TreeNode node = q.poll();
                sum += node.val;
                
                if (node.left != null) q.add(node.left);
                if (node.right != null) q.add(node.right);
            }
            res.add(sum);  // Store the sum of the current level
        }

        if (k > res.size()) return -1;
        
        res.sort(Collections.reverseOrder());  // Sort level sums in descending order
        
        return res.get(k - 1);  // Return the k-th largest sum
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Level Order Traversal (BFS)**:
   - We initialize a `Queue` for BFS and start with the root node.
   - For each level, we compute the sum of all nodes and add their left and right children to the queue for processing in the next iteration.

2. **Storing Level Sums**:
   - After processing each level, we store the sum of the current level in the list `res`.

3. **Sorting and Finding the K-th Largest Sum**:
   - After collecting all the sums, we sort them in descending order using `Collections.reverseOrder()`.
   - The `k`-th largest sum is simply the `k-1`-th element of the sorted list (since the list is 0-indexed).

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k` exceeds the number of levels, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - The BFS traversal visits each node once, so the time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Sorting the sums takes `O(L log L)`, where `L` is the number of levels (at most `n`), so sorting is `O(n log n)`.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  - The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the queue and the list storing the sums.

### Edge Cases:

- **Small Trees**:  
  - A tree with only two nodes should be correctly handled, as the second largest sum would be from the single level.
  
- **Empty Tree**:  
  - Although the problem guarantees that the tree will contain at least one node, it's good to consider that an empty tree would return `-1` if not handled properly.
