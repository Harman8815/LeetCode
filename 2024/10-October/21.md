## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, you need to split it into the maximum number of **unique** substrings such that:
- The concatenation of the substrings must form the original string.
- No substring should appear more than once in the split.

Return the maximum number of unique substrings that the string can be split into.

### Example 1:

**Input**: `s = "ababccc"`  
**Output**: `5`  
**Explanation**:  
One way to split maximally is `['a', 'b', 'ab', 'c', 'cc']`.  
Splitting like `['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'cc']` is not valid as `a` and `b` appear multiple times.

### Example 2:

**Input**: `s = "aba"`  
**Output**: `2`  
**Explanation**:  
One way to split maximally is `['a', 'ba']`.

### Example 3:

**Input**: `s = "aa"`  
**Output**: `1`  
**Explanation**:  
It is impossible to split the string into more than one unique substring.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 16`
- `s` only contains lowercase English letters.

## Solution Explanation

The goal is to split the string into the maximum number of **unique** substrings. We can use a **backtracking** approach, exploring all possible splits of the string and ensuring that the substrings we choose are unique.

### Approach

1. **Backtracking**:  
   We will use backtracking to explore every possible way to split the string into substrings. We try every possible substring starting at the current index and move forward in the string.

2. **Set for Uniqueness**:  
   To ensure all substrings are unique, we use a `HashSet` to track the substrings that have already been chosen. If a substring is already in the set, we skip it.

3. **Max Splits**:  
   During the recursive exploration, we keep track of the number of unique splits made so far. At each step, we compare and update the maximum number of unique splits.

4. **Base Case**:  
   When we reach the end of the string, we update the `maxSplits` with the current number of splits if it is larger than the previous maximum.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    HashSet<String> set;
    int maxSplits;

    public int maxUniqueSplit(String s) {
        set = new HashSet<>();
        maxSplits = 0;
        solver(s, 0, 0);
        return maxSplits;
    }

    public void solver(String str, int index, int currentSplits) {
        if (index == str.length()) {
            // Reached the end of the string, update maxSplits
            maxSplits = Math.max(maxSplits, currentSplits);
            return;
        }

        for (int i = index + 1; i <= str.length(); i++) {
            String substring = str.substring(index, i);
            // If substring is not in set, add it and continue recursion
            if (!set.contains(substring)) {
                set.add(substring);
                solver(str, i, currentSplits + 1);
                set.remove(substring); // Backtrack
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Main Function** (`maxUniqueSplit`):
   - Initializes the `set` (used to store unique substrings).
   - Initializes `maxSplits` to keep track of the maximum number of unique splits.
   - Calls the `solver` function to start the recursive exploration of the string.

2. **Backtracking Function** (`solver`):
   - This function tries all possible splits starting from the current index (`index`).
   - For each possible substring from `index` to `i`, it checks if the substring is already present in the `set`.
   - If the substring is unique (not in the `set`), it adds it to the set, moves forward by recursively calling `solver` with the updated index, and then removes the substring (backtracking step).
   - If the end of the string is reached (`index == str.length()`), it updates `maxSplits` with the current number of splits if it's larger than the previous maximum.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(2^n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. This comes from exploring every possible split, and since the string length is at most 16, the number of splits is manageable within this time complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the recursion stack and the `set` used to store substrings.

### Edge Cases:

- **String with repeated characters**: The solution correctly handles strings with repeated characters by ensuring that each substring is unique in the split.
- **String with length 1**: The solution will return `1` as the string can only be split into one unique substring.
