# [Separate Black and White Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/separate-black-and-white-balls/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-15)

## Problem Description
You are given a binary string `s` of length `n`, where `1` represents a black ball and `0` represents a white ball. In each step, you can choose two adjacent balls and swap them.

Your goal is to group all the black balls to the right and all the white balls to the left, with the minimum number of swaps.

### Example
- **Input**: `s = "001011"`
- **Output**: `4`
- **Explanation**:
  - After swapping the second and fourth elements, the string becomes `"000111"`.
  - The total number of swaps is `4`.

- **Input**: `s = "11100"`
- **Output**: `2`
- **Explanation**: 
  - After swapping the second and fourth elements, the string becomes `"01110"`.
  - The total number of swaps is `2`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Track White Balls (0's)**: The key observation is that we need to bring all `1`s (black balls) to the right, which can be achieved by pushing `0`s (white balls) to the left.
   
2. **Accumulate Swaps for Each White Ball**: For every `0` in the string, we calculate how many swaps it needs to move all the way to the left. This can be done by counting how many `1`s are to the right of it.

3. **Use a Counter for White Balls**: We maintain a `zero` counter to track how many `0`s we've encountered, and for each `0` at index `i`, the number of swaps required to move it to its correct position (on the left side) is `i - zero`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We iterate through the string once to calculate the swaps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumSteps(String s) {
        long ans = 0;
        long zero = 0; // Track number of white balls encountered
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '0') {
                ans += i - zero;  // Calculate the swaps needed for this white ball
                zero++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
