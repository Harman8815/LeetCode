### Problem: [Maximum Number of Moves in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-moves-in-a-grid/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-29)

## Problem Description:

You are given a `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of positive integers. You can start at any cell in the first column of the matrix, and traverse the grid in the following way:

- From a cell `(row, col)`, you can move to any of the cells:
  - `(row - 1, col + 1)`, 
  - `(row, col + 1)`, 
  - `(row + 1, col + 1)` 
- The value of the cell you move to should be strictly greater than the value of the current cell.

The task is to return the maximum number of moves that you can perform.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
grid = [[2,4,3,5],
        [5,4,9,3],
        [3,4,2,11],
        [10,9,13,15]]
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
Starting at the cell (0, 0), the following moves can be made:
- (0, 0) -> (0, 1)
- (0, 1) -> (1, 2)
- (1, 2) -> (2, 3)

Thus, the maximum number of moves is 3.

**Input:**
```
grid = [[3,2,4],
        [2,1,9],
        [1,1,7]]
```

**Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
Starting from any cell in the first column, no moves can be made because there is no cell with a larger value than the current cell in the next column.

### Approach:

The problem involves traversing a grid with specific movement rules, which makes it a pathfinding problem. Hereâ€™s how we can solve it:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - We can perform BFS starting from all cells in the first column because we are allowed to start from any of these cells.
   - BFS is appropriate because we want to explore all possible valid moves and compute the maximum number of moves.
   
2. **Grid Traversal**:
   - We can move to the next column (`col + 1`) while ensuring that the value of the next cell is greater than the current cell.
   - The valid moves are restricted to three possible directions: move to the cell directly to the right, move to the cell diagonally up-right, and move to the cell diagonally down-right.
   
3. **Visited Cells**:
   - We need to track visited cells to avoid revisiting them and avoid infinite loops.

4. **Queue for BFS**:
   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level, where each entry in the queue contains the current cell's position and the number of moves taken to reach that cell.

5. **Tracking Maximum Moves**:
   - For each cell visited, we update the maximum number of moves found.

### Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class Solution {

    // The three possible directions for the next column.
    private final int[] dirs = { -1, 0, 1 };

    public int maxMoves(int[][] grid) {
        int M = grid.length, N = grid[0].length;

        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[][] vis = new boolean[M][N];

        // Enqueue the cells in the first column.
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            vis[i][0] = true;
            q.offer(new int[] { i, 0, 0 });
        }

        int maxMoves = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int sz = q.size();

            while (sz-- > 0) {
                int[] v = q.poll();

                // Current cell with the number of moves made so far.
                int row = v[0], col = v[1], count = v[2];

                maxMoves = Math.max(maxMoves, count);

                // Explore possible directions in the next column
                for (int dir : dirs) {
                    // Next cell after the move.
                    int newRow = row + dir, newCol = col + 1;

                    // If the next cell isn't visited yet and is greater than
                    // the current cell value, add it to the queue with the
                    // incremented move count.
                    if (
                        newRow >= 0 &&
                        newCol >= 0 &&
                        newRow < M &&
                        newCol < N &&
                        !vis[newRow][newCol] &&
                        grid[row][col] < grid[newRow][newCol]
                    ) {
                        vis[newRow][newCol] = true;
                        q.offer(new int[] { newRow, newCol, count + 1 });
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return maxMoves;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Directions Array**:
   - `dirs = {-1, 0, 1}` represents the possible row movements: up, no movement (same row), and down.

2. **Queue Initialization**:
   - The queue `q` is used to perform BFS. Each element in the queue is an array `[row, col, count]`, where `row` and `col` represent the current cell, and `count` is the number of moves taken to reach this cell.

3. **Marking Visited Cells**:
   - The `vis` array is used to mark visited cells to avoid revisiting them and causing infinite loops.

4. **BFS Traversal**:
   - For each cell, we try moving in three possible directions to the next column (i.e., `col + 1`), and only cells with a strictly greater value than the current cell are valid.
   - If a valid move is found, we increment the `count` (representing the number of moves) and enqueue the new cell.

5. **Tracking Maximum Moves**:
   - The variable `maxMoves` keeps track of the maximum number of moves encountered during the BFS traversal.

6. **Final Result**:
   - After processing all the cells, we return `maxMoves` as the result.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because in the worst case, each cell is visited once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n)** for the queue and the `visited` array.

### Conclusion:
This approach efficiently solves the problem using BFS to explore all possible valid paths from the first column and keeps track of the longest path in terms of moves.
