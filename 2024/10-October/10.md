# [Maximum Width Ramp](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-ramp/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-10)

## Problem Description
A ramp in an integer array `nums` is a pair `(i, j)` for which `i < j` and `nums[i] <= nums[j]`. The width of such a ramp is `j - i`.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum width of a ramp in `nums`. If there is no ramp in `nums`, return `0`.

### Example
- **Input**: `nums = [6,0,8,2,1,5]`
  - **Output**: `4`
  - **Explanation**: The maximum width ramp is achieved at `(i, j) = (1, 5)`: `nums[1] = 0` and `nums[5] = 5`.
  
- **Input**: `nums = [9,8,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,1]`
  - **Output**: `7`
  - **Explanation**: The maximum width ramp is achieved at `(i, j) = (2, 9)`: `nums[2] = 1` and `nums[9] = 1`.

### Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Use a Stack**: Utilize a stack to store indices of the array in increasing order of their values. This allows us to quickly identify potential starting points for ramps.
2. **Fill the Stack**: Iterate through the array `nums` and push indices into the stack if:
   - The stack is empty, or
   - The current value is less than the value at the index at the top of the stack.
3. **Calculate Maximum Width**: Traverse the array from the end to the start:
   - While the stack is not empty and the value at the index at the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current value:
     - Update the maximum width by comparing it with the current width (`j - i`).
     - Pop the index from the stack since it has been processed.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`, since each index is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the stack in the worst case.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxWidthRamp(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        Stack<Integer> indicesStack = new Stack<>();

        // Fill the stack with indices in increasing order of their values
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (indicesStack.isEmpty() || nums[indicesStack.peek()] > nums[i]) {
                indicesStack.push(i);
            }
        }

        int maxWidth = 0;

        // Traverse the array from the end to the start
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            while (
                !indicesStack.isEmpty() && nums[indicesStack.peek()] <= nums[j]
            ) {
                maxWidth = Math.max(maxWidth, j - indicesStack.peek());
                // Pop the index since it's already processed
                indicesStack.pop();
            }
        }

        return maxWidth;
    }
}
