### Problem: [Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-sub-folders-from-the-filesystem/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-25)

## Problem Description

You are given a list of folder paths in a filesystem. The task is to remove any sub-folders that are contained within another folder. A folder is considered a sub-folder if it is contained within another folder, which means the folder path starts with another folder path, followed by a `/`. The goal is to return the folders that are not sub-folders.

### Example 1:

**Input**:  
`folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]`

**Output**:  
`[ "/a", "/c/d", "/c/f"]`

**Explanation**:  
- `/a/b` is a sub-folder of `/a`.
- `/c/d/e` is a sub-folder of `/c/d`.
Thus, the output consists only of the non-subfolders: `/a`, `/c/d`, and `/c/f`.

### Example 2:

**Input**:  
`folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]`

**Output**:  
`[ "/a"]`

**Explanation**:  
- `/a/b/c` and `/a/b/d` are sub-folders of `/a`.
Thus, only `/a` is returned.

### Example 3:

**Input**:  
`folder = ["/a/b/c", "/a/b/ca", "/a/b/d"]`

**Output**:  
`[ "/a/b/c", "/a/b/ca", "/a/b/d"]`

**Explanation**:  
There are no sub-folders among these paths, so the result includes all the paths.

### Constraints:
- The number of folders is between `1` and `40,000`.
- Each folder path is at least 2 characters long and no longer than 100 characters.
- Each folder name is unique.
- Each folder path starts with a `/`.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, the key observation is:
- A folder path that is a sub-folder will always start with a longer folder path followed by a `/`.

### Algorithm:
1. **Sort the Folders**:  
   We start by sorting the folder paths. Sorting ensures that any potential sub-folder will appear after its parent folder in the sorted order.

2. **Iterate through the Sorted Folders**:  
   As we go through the sorted list of folders, for each folder, we check if it is a sub-folder of the previous folder in the list. If a folder is a sub-folder, we skip it; otherwise, we keep it in the result.

3. **Use a Set for Fast Lookup**:  
   We can use a `Set` to store the folder paths for efficient checking if a folder is a sub-folder of another.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> removeSubfolders(String[] folder) {
        // Sort the folder paths
        Arrays.sort(folder);
        
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Start with the first folder as the root
        String prevFolder = "";
        
        for (String f : folder) {
            // Check if the current folder is a sub-folder of the previous one
            if (f.startsWith(prevFolder + "/")) {
                // It is a sub-folder, so we skip it
                continue;
            }
            
            // It is not a sub-folder, so we add it to the result
            result.add(f);
            
            // Update the previous folder to the current one
            prevFolder = f;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**:  
   First, the folder paths are sorted. Sorting ensures that if a folder is a sub-folder, it will appear after its parent folder in the sorted list.

2. **Iterating through the Folders**:  
   - We iterate through the sorted list of folders.
   - For each folder, we check if it starts with the previous folder's path followed by `/`. If it does, it is a sub-folder, and we skip adding it to the result.
   - Otherwise, we add the current folder to the result and update `prevFolder` to the current folder path.

3. **Returning the Result**:  
   After the iteration, the `result` list contains all the non-sub-folder paths, which are then returned.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Sorting the folder paths takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of folders.
  - Iterating through the folder list takes `O(n)` to check the prefix condition for each folder.
  Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is `O(n)` for storing the result and for sorting the input.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Folder**:  
   If there's only one folder, the result is always the input folder.
   
2. **No Sub-Folders**:  
   If none of the folders are sub-folders of others, the result will be the same as the input.

3. **All Folders are Sub-Folders**:  
   If all folders are sub-folders of the root, the result will just include the root folder.

This solution efficiently solves the problem while ensuring we adhere to the constraints.
