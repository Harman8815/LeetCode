### Problem: [Longest Square Streak in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-square-streak-in-an-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-28)

## Problem Description:

You are given an integer array `nums`. A subsequence of `nums` is called a **square streak** if:
1. The length of the subsequence is at least 2.
2. After sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the square of the previous number.

You need to return the length of the longest square streak in `nums`. If there is no square streak, return `-1`.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
nums = [4,3,6,16,8,2]
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- Choose the subsequence `[4,16,2]`. After sorting it, it becomes `[2,4,16]`.
- 4 = 2 * 2.
- 16 = 4 * 4.
Thus, the subsequence `[4, 16, 2]` is a valid square streak of length 3.

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [2,3,5,6,7]
```

**Output:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation:**
There is no square streak in `nums`, so return `-1`.

### Approach:

1. **Sorting**:
   - We start by sorting the input array `nums`. Sorting will allow us to check each number in increasing order and see if it's part of a valid square streak (where each number is the square of the previous one).

2. **Use HashSet for Fast Lookup**:
   - We use a `HashSet` to store the elements of `nums`. This allows us to quickly check if a number is part of the array, which helps in verifying if the square of a number exists in the array.

3. **Finding Square Streaks**:
   - We iterate through the sorted array, and for each number, we attempt to form a streak by repeatedly squaring the number.
   - If the square of the current number exists in the array, we continue the streak; otherwise, we break.
   
4. **Tracking the Maximum Streak**:
   - We keep track of the longest valid streak encountered during the iteration.

5. **Edge Case**:
   - If no streak of length at least 2 is found, return `-1`.

### Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public int longestSquareStreak(int[] nums) {
        // Sort the array to check for square sequences in order
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        // Create a HashSet for quick lookups
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        int max = 0;

        // Add all elements of nums into the set
        for (int num : nums) {
            set.add(num);
        }

        // Iterate through the sorted array and check for square streaks
        for (int num : nums) {
            int temp = 0;
            long current = num;
            
            // Try to form a streak of squares starting from num
            while (set.contains((int)current)) {
                temp++;
                // If squaring the number exceeds the limit, stop the loop
                if (current * current > 1e5) break;
                current *= current;  // Move to the next square
            }
            
            // Update the max length of the streak
            max = Math.max(max, temp);
        }

        // If no streak of length at least 2 was found, return -1
        return max < 2 ? -1 : max;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting the Input**:
   - Sorting the input array allows us to examine each number in increasing order, which makes it easier to check if the next number is the square of the current number.
   
2. **Set for Fast Lookups**:
   - A `HashSet` is used to store the numbers for constant-time lookups. This helps efficiently verify if the square of a number exists in the array.

3. **Building Streaks**:
   - For each number in the sorted array, we try to build a streak by repeatedly squaring the number (`current *= current`) and checking if that number is in the set. The streak continues as long as the squared number exists in the set.

4. **Tracking the Maximum Streak**:
   - We keep track of the longest streak found, and if no valid streak of length 2 or more is found, we return `-1`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n log n)** for sorting the array, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
- **O(n)** for iterating through the sorted array and checking each number's streak in the `HashSet`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** for storing the numbers in the `HashSet`.

### Edge Cases:
- If no valid square streak is found, the function returns `-1`.
- The input array is sorted first, ensuring that the subsequences are checked in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
This approach efficiently finds the longest square streak in the array by leveraging sorting and hashing.
