# [Maximal Score After Applying K Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-score-after-applying-k-operations/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-14)

## Problem Description
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You start with a score of 0. In one operation, you can:
1. Choose an index `i` such that `0 <= i < nums.length`,
2. Increase your score by `nums[i]`, and
3. Replace `nums[i]` with `ceil(nums[i] / 3)`.

Your goal is to apply exactly `k` operations and return the maximum possible score.

The `ceil` function rounds a number to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number.

### Example
- **Input**: `nums = [10,10,10,10,10]`, `k = 5`
- **Output**: `50`
- **Explanation**: Apply the operation to each array element exactly once. The final score is `10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50`.

- **Input**: `nums = [1,10,3,3,3]`, `k = 3`
- **Output**: `17`
- **Explanation**: You can do the following operations:
  - Operation 1: Select `i = 1`, so `nums` becomes `[1, 4, 3, 3, 3]`. Your score increases by 10.
  - Operation 2: Select `i = 1`, so `nums` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`. Your score increases by 4.
  - Operation 3: Select `i = 2`, so `nums` becomes `[1, 2, 1, 3, 3]`. Your score increases by 3.
  - The final score is `10 + 4 + 3 = 17`.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Use a Max-Heap (Priority Queue)**: 
   - Since the goal is to maximize the score, at each step, we should always pick the largest element in `nums` to apply the operation. A max-heap (priority queue) allows us to efficiently retrieve and update the largest element.
   
2. **Perform `k` Operations**:
   - For each operation, pick the maximum element, add it to the score, then replace it with `ceil(nums[i] / 3)` and reinsert it into the heap.
   
3. **Return the Final Score** after exactly `k` operations.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Constructing the priority queue takes O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
  - Each operation takes O(log n) due to heap operations (insert and extract). Since we perform `k` operations, the total time complexity is O(k log n).
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - O(n) for storing the priority queue.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public long maxKelements(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Priority Queue to maintain the max element at the top
        PriorityQueue<Long> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.reverseOrder());
        
        // Insert all elements into the priority queue
        for (int i : nums) pq.offer((long) i);
        
        long score = 0;
        
        // Perform k operations
        while (k-- > 0) {
            long item = pq.poll();  // Get the maximum element
            score += item;          // Add to the score
            
            // Replace it with ceil(item / 3) and reinsert it into the heap
            item = (long) Math.ceil(item / 3.0);
            pq.offer(item);
        }
        
        return score;  // Return the accumulated score
    }
}
