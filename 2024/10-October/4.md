# [Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-players-into-teams-of-equal-skill/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-04)

## Problem Description
You are given a positive integer array `skill` of even length `n` where `skill[i]` denotes the skill of the `i`th player. Divide the players into `n / 2` teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.

The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team. Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return -1 if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

### Example
- **Input**: `skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]`
  - **Output**: `22`
  - **Explanation**: Divide the players into the following teams: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), where each team has a total skill of 6. The sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: 1 * 5 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22.

- **Input**: `skill = [3,4]`
  - **Output**: `12`
  - **Explanation**: The two players form a team with a total skill of 7. The chemistry of the team is 3 * 4 = 12.

- **Input**: `skill = [1,1,2,3]`
  - **Output**: `-1`
  - **Explanation**: There is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

### Constraints
- The length of `skill` is even.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the skill levels.
2. **Calculate Target Skill**: The target skill for each team is the sum of the smallest and largest skill levels.
3. **Pair Players**: Iterate through the sorted array, pairing players from the start and end. If the paired skill levels do not match the target, return -1.
4. **Calculate Chemistry**: For each valid pair, calculate the chemistry and accumulate the total.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the number of players.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of additional space.

## Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public long dividePlayers(int[] skill) {
        Arrays.sort(skill);

        int n = skill.length;
        long totalChemistry = 0;

        // Calculate the target sum
        int targetTeamSkill = skill[0] + skill[n - 1];

        // Iterate through half of the array, pairing players from both ends
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            int currentTeamSkill = skill[i] + skill[n - i - 1];

            // If any team's skill doesn't match the target, return -1
            if (currentTeamSkill != targetTeamSkill) {
                return -1;
            }

            // Calculate and add the chemistry of the current team
            totalChemistry += (long) skill[i] * (long) skill[n - i - 1];
        }

        return totalChemistry;
    }
}
