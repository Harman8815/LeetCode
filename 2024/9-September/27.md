## Problem Description
You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all three events).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers `start` and `end` that represents a booking on the half-open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

Implement the `MyCalendarTwo` class:

- `MyCalendarTwo()` Initializes the calendar object.
- `boolean book(int start, int end)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

### Example
- Input:
  ```java
  MyCalendarTwo obj = new MyCalendarTwo();
  boolean param_1 = obj.book(10, 20); // Returns true
  boolean param_2 = obj.book(15, 25); // Returns true
  boolean param_3 = obj.book(20, 30); // Returns true
  boolean param_4 = obj.book(5, 15);  // Returns false
  ```

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Storage of Events**: Use two lists to keep track of all booked events and overlaps.
   - `calendar`: stores all the booked events.
   - `overlaps`: stores intervals that indicate overlaps between events.
2. **Checking for Triple Booking**: Before adding a new booking, check the `overlaps` list to see if there is any conflict. If there is, return `false`.
3. **Adding Events**: If no conflict is found, check the existing events in `calendar` and update the `overlaps` list with the intervals that intersect with the new event.
4. **Adding the New Event**: If no triple booking occurs, add the new event to `calendar`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of events booked so far, due to the need to check against all previously booked events and overlaps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the booked events and overlaps.

## Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import List;

class MyCalendarTwo {
    List<int[]> calendar;   
    List<int[]> overlaps;   

    public MyCalendarTwo() {
        calendar = new ArrayList<>();
        overlaps = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        for (int[] iv : overlaps) {
            if (iv[0] < end && start < iv[1]) { 
                return false;
            }
        }
        for (int[] iv : calendar) {
            if (iv[0] < end && start < iv[1]) {  
                overlaps.add(new int[] { Math.max(start, iv[0]), Math.min(end, iv[1]) });
            }
        }
        calendar.add(new int[] { start, end });
        return true;
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyCalendarTwo object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyCalendarTwo obj = new MyCalendarTwo();
 * boolean param_1 = obj.book(start,end);
 */
```
