# [Uncommon Words from Two Sentences](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-17)

## Problem Description
A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences `s1` and `s2`, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example
- Input: `s1 = "apple apple"`, `s2 = "banana"`
- Output: `["banana"]`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Split Sentences into Words**: Use the `split` method to convert each sentence into an array of words.
2. **Count Word Frequencies**: Utilize a `HashMap` to count occurrences of each word in both sentences.
3. **Identify Uncommon Words**: Iterate through the word count map and collect words that appear exactly once.
4. **Return the Result**: Convert the list of uncommon words to an array and return it.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` is the number of words in `s1` and `m` is the number of words in `s2`, due to the counting and checking steps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for storing the words in the hash map.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String[] uncommonFromSentences(String s1, String s2) {
        String[] arr1 = s1.split(" ");
        String[] arr2 = s2.split(" ");
        
        HashMap<String, Integer> wordCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String word : arr1) 
            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        
        for (String word : arr2) 
            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        
        ArrayList<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (String word : wordCount.keySet()) 
            if (wordCount.get(word) == 1) 
                result.add(word);
        
        return result.toArray(new String[0]);
    }
}
