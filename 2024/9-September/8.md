# [Split Linked List in Parts](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-08725)

## Problem Description
Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer `k`, split the linked list into `k` consecutive parts. The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. If there are not enough nodes to fill all parts, the remaining parts should be `null`.

The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.

Return an array of the `k` parts.

### Example
- Input: `head = [1, 2, 3], k = 5`
- Output: `[[1], [2], [3], [], []]`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Calculate Length**: Traverse the linked list to compute its total length.
2. **Determine Part Sizes**: The size of each part should be calculated based on dividing the length by `k`. Some parts may need to be longer by 1, depending on the remainder of the division.
3. **Split the List**: For each part, create a new linked list with the calculated size, moving the pointer forward as you assign nodes.
4. **Edge Cases**: If there are fewer nodes than `k`, some parts will be `null`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + k), where N is the number of nodes in the list. We traverse the list once to calculate the length, and another time to split the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), for storing the parts in an array.

## Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public ListNode[] splitListToParts(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode[] arr = new ListNode[k];
        int length = 0;
        ListNode current = head;
        
        // Calculate the length of the list
        while (current != null) {
            length++;
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        int partSize = length / k;   // Base size of each part
        int extraNodes = length % k; // Extra nodes to distribute
        
        current = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
            ListNode write = dummy;
            int currentPartSize = partSize + (i < extraNodes ? 1 : 0);
            
            for (int j = 0; j < currentPartSize; j++) {
                write.next = new ListNode(current.val);
                write = write.next;
                if (current != null) {
                    current = current.next;
                }
            }
            arr[i] = dummy.next; // Assign the part to the result array
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
}
