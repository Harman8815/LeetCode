# [Minimum Time Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-16)

## Problem Description
Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.

### Example
- Input: `timePoints = ["23:59", "00:00"]`
- Output: `1`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Transform each time point from "HH:MM" format into total minutes from midnight.
2. **Sort the Time Points**: Sort the array of minutes to easily find the minimum difference.
3. **Calculate Minimum Differences**:
   - Iterate through the sorted minutes and find the minimum difference between adjacent elements.
   - Consider the wrap-around case by calculating the difference between the last and first elements (to account for the circular nature of time).
4. **Return the Minimum Difference**: The result is the smallest difference found.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of time points due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the converted time points.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinDifference(List<String> timePoints) {
        // convert input to minutes
        int[] minutes = new int[timePoints.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < timePoints.size(); i++) {
            String time = timePoints.get(i);
            int h = Integer.parseInt(time.substring(0, 2));
            int m = Integer.parseInt(time.substring(3));
            minutes[i] = h * 60 + m;
        }

        // sort times in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(minutes);

        // find minimum difference across adjacent elements
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < minutes.length - 1; i++) {
            ans = Math.min(ans, minutes[i + 1] - minutes[i]);
        }

        // consider difference between last and first element
        return Math.min(
            ans,
            24 * 60 - minutes[minutes.length - 1] + minutes[0]
        );
    }
}
