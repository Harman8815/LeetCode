# [Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-1d-array-into-2d-array/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-012022)

## Problem Description
You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array `original`, and two integers, `m` and `n`. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with `m` rows and `n` columns using all the elements from `original`.

The elements from indices 0 to `n - 1` (inclusive) of `original` should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices `n` to `2 * n - 1` (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an `m x n` 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.

### Example
- Input: `original = [1,2,3,4]`, `m = 2`, `n = 2`
  Output: `[[1,2],[3,4]]`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Check Dimensions**: First, check if `m * n` equals the length of `original`. If not, return an empty array.
2. **Construct the 2D Array**: Use a nested loop to fill the 2D array with elements from the `original` array by keeping track of the index.
3. **Return Result**: After populating the 2D array, return it.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. This is due to the nested loops to populate the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the resulting 2D array.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] construct2DArray(int[] original, int m, int n) {
        int ans[][] = new int[m][n];
        int index = 0;
        if (m * n != original.length) 
            return new int[0][0];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                ans[i][j] = original[index++];
        return index == original.length ? ans : new int[0][0];
    }
}
