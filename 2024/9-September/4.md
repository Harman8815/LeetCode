# [Walking Robot Simulation](https://leetcode.com/problems/walking-robot-simulation/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-04874)

## Problem Description
A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point (0, 0) facing north. The robot receives an array of integers `commands`, which represents a sequence of moves that it needs to execute. There are only three possible types of instructions the robot can receive:

- `-2`: Turn left 90 degrees.
- `-1`: Turn right 90 degrees.
- `1 <= k <= 9`: Move forward `k` units, one unit at a time.

Some of the grid squares are obstacles. The ith obstacle is at grid point `obstacles[i] = (xi, yi)`. If the robot runs into an obstacle, it will stay in its current location (on the block adjacent to the obstacle) and move onto the next command.

Return the maximum squared Euclidean distance that the robot reaches at any point in its path (i.e. if the distance is 5, return 25).

### Example
- Input: `commands = [4,-1,3], obstacles = []`
  Output: `25`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Store Obstacles**: Use a `HashSet` to store obstacles for efficient lookup while the robot moves.
2. **Define Directions**: Use a 2D array to represent direction vectors for North, East, South, and West.
3. **Process Commands**:
   - For turning commands (`-1` and `-2`), update the current direction.
   - For move commands, attempt to move forward in the current direction, checking for obstacles at each step.
   - Update the maximum squared distance whenever the robot moves.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the number of commands and m is the number of obstacles. The lookup for obstacles is O(1) on average due to the `HashSet`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of obstacles stored in the `HashSet`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {

    private static final int HASH_MULTIPLIER = 60013; // Slightly larger than 2 * max coordinate value

    public int robotSim(int[] commands, int[][] obstacles) {
        // Store obstacles in an HashSet for efficient lookup
        Set<Integer> obstacleSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int[] obstacle : obstacles) {
            obstacleSet.add(hashCoordinates(obstacle[0], obstacle[1]));
        }

        // Define direction vectors: North, East, South, West
        int[][] directions = { { 0, 1 }, { 1, 0 }, { 0, -1 }, { -1, 0 } };

        int[] currentPosition = { 0, 0 };
        int maxDistanceSquared = 0;
        int currentDirection = 0; // 0: North, 1: East, 2: South, 3: West

        for (int command : commands) {
            if (command == -1) {
                // Turn right
                currentDirection = (currentDirection + 1) % 4;
                continue;
            }
            if (command == -2) {
                // Turn left
                currentDirection = (currentDirection + 3) % 4;
                continue;
            }

            // Move forward
            int[] direction = directions[currentDirection];
            for (int step = 0; step < command; step++) {
                int nextX = currentPosition[0] + direction[0];
                int nextY = currentPosition[1] + direction[1];
                if (obstacleSet.contains(hashCoordinates(nextX, nextY))) {
                    break;
                }
                currentPosition[0] = nextX;
                currentPosition[1] = nextY;
            }

            maxDistanceSquared = Math.max(
                maxDistanceSquared,
                currentPosition[0] * currentPosition[0] +
                currentPosition[1] * currentPosition[1]
            );
        }

        return maxDistanceSquared;
    }

    // Hash function to convert (x, y) coordinates to a unique integer value
    private int hashCoordinates(int x, int y) {
        return x + HASH_MULTIPLIER * y;
    }
}
