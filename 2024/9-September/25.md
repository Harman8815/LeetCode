# [Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-prefix-scores-of-strings/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-25)

## Problem Description
You are given an array `words` of size `n` consisting of non-empty strings.

We define the score of a string `term` as the number of strings `words[i]` such that `term` is a prefix of `words[i]`.

For example, if `words = ["a", "ab", "abc", "cab"]`, then the score of `"ab"` is `2`, since `"ab"` is a prefix of both `"ab"` and `"abc"`.

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the sum of scores of every non-empty prefix of `words[i]`.

Note that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.

### Example
- Input: `words = ["abc", "ab"]`
- Output: `[5, 3]`
- Explanation:
  - For `"abc"`, the prefixes are `"a"` (1), `"ab"` (2), and `"abc"` (2) → Total = 5
  - For `"ab"`, the prefixes are `"a"` (1) and `"ab"` (2) → Total = 3

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Trie Data Structure**: Use a Trie to efficiently store all prefixes of the words. Each node will keep track of how many words share that prefix.
2. **Inserting Words**: For each word, insert its characters into the Trie and increment the count at each node.
3. **Calculating Scores**: For each word, traverse its prefixes in the Trie and accumulate the counts to get the total score for that word.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * L), where `N` is the number of words and `L` is the maximum length of a word, due to inserting words into the Trie and calculating prefix scores.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * L), for storing the Trie.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    class TrieNode {
        TrieNode[] children;
        int count; 
        TrieNode() {
            children = new TrieNode[26];
            count = 0;
        }
    }
    
    public int[] sumPrefixScores(String[] words) {
        TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
        
        // Insert words into Trie
        for (String word : words) {
            TrieNode node = root;
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                int idx = c - 'a';
                if (node.children[idx] == null) {
                    node.children[idx] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node.children[idx];
                node.count++; 
            }
        }
        
        int[] result = new int[words.length];
        // Calculate scores for each word
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            TrieNode node = root;
            int score = 0;
            for (char c : words[i].toCharArray()) {
                node = node.children[c - 'a'];
                score += node.count;
            }
            result[i] = score;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
