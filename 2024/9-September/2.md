# [Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-student-that-will-replace-the-chalk/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-021894)

## Problem Description
There are `n` students in a class numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number `n - 1`. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `chalk` and an integer `k`. There are initially `k` pieces of chalk. When the student number `i` is given a problem to solve, they will use `chalk[i]` pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than `chalk[i]`, then the student number `i` will be asked to replace the chalk.

Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.

### Example
- Input: `chalk = [5,1,5]`, `k = 22`
  Output: `0`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Calculate Total Chalk Used**: Iterate through the `chalk` array to calculate the total pieces of chalk used by all students.
2. **Modulo Operation**: Use the modulo operation on `k` with the total chalk to find the remaining chalk after full rounds.
3. **Determine the Replacing Student**: Iterate through the `chalk` array again to find which student will not have enough chalk to solve their problem.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of students. The algorithm involves two passes through the chalk array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int chalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int k) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i : chalk) {
            sum += i;
            if (sum > k) break;
        }
        k = k % (int) sum;
        for (int i = 0; i < chalk.length; i++) {
            if (k < chalk[i]) return i;
            k = k - chalk[i];
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
