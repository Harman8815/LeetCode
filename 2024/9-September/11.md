# [Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-bit-flips-to-convert-number/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-112220)

## Problem Description
A bit flip of a number `x` is choosing a bit in the binary representation of `x` and flipping it from either `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`.

Given two integers `start` and `goal`, return the minimum number of bit flips required to convert `start` into `goal`.

### Example
- Input: `start = 10, goal = 7`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: The binary representation of `start` is `1010` and `goal` is `0111`. To convert `start` to `goal`, we need to flip three bits.

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **XOR Operation**: Perform an XOR operation between `start` and `goal`. XOR will result in a `1` wherever the bits differ between the two numbers.
2. **Count Set Bits**: The number of set bits (1s) in the result of the XOR gives the number of bit flips required.
3. **Right-Shift**: Right-shift the XOR result bit by bit to count the set bits.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(logN), where N is the number of bits in the integers. We check each bit of the XOR result.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the space used is constant.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int count = 0; 
        // XOR will give 1 where the bits are different
        int xor = start ^ goal;

        while(xor != 0){
            // If the last bit is 1, increment count 
            count += xor & 1;

            // Right-shift to check the next bit
            xor >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
