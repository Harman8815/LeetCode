# [My Calendar I](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-26)

## Problem Description
You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers `start` and `end` that represents a booking on the half-open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

Implement the `MyCalendar` class:

- `MyCalendar()` Initializes the calendar object.
- `boolean book(int start, int end)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

### Example
- Input:
  ```java
  MyCalendar obj = new MyCalendar();
  boolean param_1 = obj.book(10, 20); // Returns true
  boolean param_2 = obj.book(15, 25); // Returns false
  boolean param_3 = obj.book(20, 30); // Returns true
  ```

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Storage of Events**: Use a list to store the intervals of booked events.
2. **Checking for Conflicts**: For each new booking, check against existing bookings to see if there is any overlap. An overlap occurs if `start < iv[1]` and `iv[0] < end` for any existing interval `iv`.
3. **Adding Events**: If there is no conflict, add the new event to the list.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of events booked so far, because we need to check against all previously booked events.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the booked events.

## Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import List;

public class MyCalendar {
    List<int[]> calendar;

    public MyCalendar() {
        calendar = new ArrayList();
    }

    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        for (int[] iv : calendar) {
            if (iv[0] < end && start < iv[1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        calendar.add(new int[]{start, end});
        return true;
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyCalendar obj = new MyCalendar();
 * boolean param_1 = obj.book(start,end);
 */
```
