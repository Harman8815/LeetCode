# [Find Missing Observations](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-missing-observations/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-05)

## Problem Description
You have observations of `n + m` 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. `n` of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of `m` rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the `n + m` rolls.

You are given an integer array `rolls` of length `m` where `rolls[i]` is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers `mean` and `n`.

Return an array of length `n` containing the missing observations such that the average value of the `n + m` rolls is exactly `mean`. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

The average value of a set of `k` numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by `k`.

### Example
- Input: `rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2`
  Output: `[6, 6]`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Sum the values in the `rolls` array to get the total of the known rolls.
2. **Calculate Remaining Sum**: The total sum required for all `n + m` rolls can be computed as `mean * (n + m)`. Subtract the current sum from this to find the sum of the missing rolls.
3. **Check Validity**: 
   - The sum of the missing rolls must be at least `n` (if all are `1`) and at most `6 * n` (if all are `6`).
4. **Distribute Values**: Calculate the average value for the missing rolls and distribute any remainder evenly among the missing rolls.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where m is the number of rolls and n is the number of missing observations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the result of the missing observations.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {

    public int[] missingRolls(int[] rolls, int mean, int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int roll : rolls) {
            sum = sum + roll;
        }
        // Find the remaining sum.
        int remainingSum = mean * (n + rolls.length) - sum;
        // Check if sum is valid or not.
        if (remainingSum > 6 * n || remainingSum < n) {
            return new int[0];
        }
        int distributeMean = remainingSum / n;
        int mod = remainingSum % n;
        // Distribute the remaining mod elements in nElements array.
        int[] nElements = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(nElements, distributeMean);
        for (int i = 0; i < mod; i++) {
            nElements[i]++;
        }
        return nElements;
    }
}
