# [K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-in-lexicographical-order/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-22)

## Problem Description
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the k-th lexicographically smallest integer in the range `[1, n]`.

### Example
- Input: `n = 13`, `k = 2`
- Output: `10`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Prefix Tree Concept**: Treat numbers as a tree where each digit represents a level. The root represents all numbers starting with `1` through `9`.
2. **Count Steps**: For each prefix, calculate how many numbers exist in the range `[prefix, prefix + 1)`. 
3. **Navigating the Tree**: 
   - If the count of numbers (steps) is less than or equal to `k`, move to the next prefix (`curr++`).
   - If the count is greater than `k`, move deeper into the tree by multiplying the current prefix by `10` (`curr *= 10`).

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), as we traverse down the levels of the tree.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthNumber(int n, int k) {
        int curr = 1;
        k--;

        while (k > 0) {
            int step = countSteps(n, curr, curr + 1);
            // If the steps are less than or equal to k, we skip this prefix's subtree
            if (step <= k) {
                // Move to the next prefix and decrease k by the number of steps we skip
                curr++;
                k -= step;
            } else {
                // Move to the next level of the tree and decrement k by 1
                curr *= 10;
                k--;
            }
        }

        return curr;
    }

    // To count how many numbers exist between prefix1 and prefix2
    private int countSteps(int n, long prefix1, long prefix2) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (prefix1 <= n) {
            steps += Math.min(n + 1, prefix2) - prefix1;
            prefix1 *= 10;
            prefix2 *= 10;
        }
        return steps;
    }
}
