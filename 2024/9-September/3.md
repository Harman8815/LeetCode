# [Sum of Digits of String After Convert](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-of-string-after-convert/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-031945)

## Problem Description
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer `k`. Your task is to convert the string into an integer by a special process, and then transform it by summing its digits repeatedly `k` times. More specifically, perform the following steps:

1. Convert `s` into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e. replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26).
2. Transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits.
3. Repeat the transform operation (step 2) `k` times in total.

For example, if `s = "zbax"` and `k = 2`, then the resulting integer would be `8` by the following operations:

- Convert: "zbax" ➝ "(26)(2)(1)(24)" ➝ "262124" ➝ 262124
- Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17
- Transform #2: 17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8

Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described above.

### Example
- Input: `s = "zbax"`, `k = 2`
  Output: `8`

## Solution Explanation

### Approach
1. **Convert Characters to Numbers**: Iterate through the string `s`, converting each character to its corresponding integer value based on its position in the alphabet and concatenate them into a string.
2. **Repeated Transformation**: Perform the digit sum transformation `k` times. For each transformation, sum the digits of the current string representation of the number.
3. **Return Result**: Convert the final string back to an integer and return it.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k), where n is the length of the string and k is the number of transformations. The outer loop runs k times, and the inner loop processes the characters.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we create a string to hold the concatenated values.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int getLucky(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            int temp = ch - 'a' + 1;
            str.append(temp);
        }

        while (k-- > 0) {
            str = new StringBuilder(helper(str.toString()));
        }

        return Integer.parseInt(str.toString());
    }

    public String helper(String str) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
            sum += ch - '0';
        }
        return String.valueOf(sum);
    }
}
